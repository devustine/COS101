# Application of Computers in Social Research and Administration

## How Computers Have Changed Data Collection

The way data is gathered and maintained has been changed by computers. The way we collect data has been transformed by computers. Now you can send and collect data electronically. Using your computer, you send out surveys and questionnaires, then you collect that feedback and are able to collect your data electronically. This has a huge impact on social research.

## Notable Uses of Computers in Social Research and Administration

### 1. Data Collection

Data collection has changed your research. You can have questionnaires to find out and research a particular problem. To collect the data, you can use Google Forms and create questions there. Then you send those questions to people to respond, and from them you collect your data.

#### Benefits of Electronic Data Collection:
- **Wider Reach**: You can reach more people who have questionnaires and push them to your Facebook. Imagine you have maybe 1000 friends or 2000 friends and push it to them - that can reach a larger audience.
- **Online Surveys**: Researchers can use online surveys and electronic data collection techniques. Electronic forms can come in handy - you fill the form and then push it out.
- **Direct Computer Input**: Researchers can gather data directly into a computer, minimizing errors and enabling data validation.
- **Data Validation**: You can have particular text fields that only accept integers. Anything outside integer values will not be accepted, minimizing errors and enhancing data quality.

You can use Google Forms to create questions and share your URL link on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. People can view the form and respond. Once you've collected that data, the next step is to analyze it.

### 2. Data Analysis and Statistics

Computer software also comes in handy here and may help with social research and administration through:
- **Media Analysis**: Special packages that can help automate data analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Software packages for social sciences help you conduct analysis

#### Analysis Tools:
- **SPSS**: Can help you do data analysis and complicated data analysis
- **IBM SPSS**: Statistical package for social sciences that helps with robust analysis
- **Software as a Service**: Tools that help you collect your data for analysis

#### Example Analysis:
Once you collect data, you can analyze it. For example, "How many persons prefer public school to private school?" The analysis might tell you that 100 persons prefer to go to public schools rather than private schools. You have software packages that can help you with complicated problem statements and robust analysis.

### 3. Data Management and Storage

Computers can help you store your data. You have files and data you've collected, and you can store that in:
- **Database Management Systems**
- **Cloud Facilities**: You can push large files (gigabytes) to cloud facilities for storage

#### Storage Solutions:
Social research data management and storage have been completely transformed by computers. Researchers can organize their data using digital databases and data management systems. You can have your data stored and records maintained either:
- **Local System**: On your local machine
- **Cloud**: Shipped to the cloud

#### Data Security Features:
These systems provide capabilities like:
- **Data Security**: Your database will have a login page where you enter username and password
- **Access Control**: Database administrators have reasonable passwords so that unauthorized users cannot access the database and compromise its integrity
- **Data Sharing**: You can share with friends or download particular tables to share with collaborators
- **Version Control**: If something happens to your infrastructure and the system goes down, you can restore previous versions. You periodically back up files, and if the system fails, you can start up a fresh database and restore from backups.

**Example Database**: Microsoft SQL Server provides these capabilities. Once you log in, you can see tables and data - that's how a database looks.

### 4. Social Network Analysis

To analyze social networks, computers are essential. As mentioned earlier, you might have:
- Person A is friends with Person B
- Person A is also friends with Person C and Person D
- Person B is friends with Person D
- Person A is also friends with Person D
- Person C is friends with Person F

Your computer can help analyze this social network. These connections are nodes - you have 5 nodes total. You can analyze how many edges (connections) exist between people. Computers can help you:
- Determine relationships (e.g., "Is person A friends with person D?")
- Visualize social connections and relationships
- Analyze network patterns

### 5. Administrative Management

Computers can be handy for managing particular cases in health spaces. For example:
- **Healthcare Administration**: Someone who is infected with tuberculosis or malaria can be managed through computer systems
- **Health Records**: When a person walks in, you capture their vitals and send that information to a doctor or particular facility where tests can be carried out
- **Case Management**: The process helps with record management and client administration

#### Healthcare System Integration:
When someone comes to your healthcare facility, you begin to collect health record details. That information flows into another facility for laboratory tests. Once tests are done, the record is updated and can flow to another system that recommends drugs or treatments. This enables comprehensive case management and client record maintenance.

#### Program Evaluation:
- **Government Programs**: The government can use computers to evaluate school feeding programs and track progress
- **Project Tracking**: Systems can help track projects, monitor completion percentages (e.g., 50% completion in the first month, 60% completion the next month)
- **Progress Monitoring**: Detailed tracking of administrative management initiatives

#### Administrative Management Tools:
Typical administrative management tools help with:
- **Project Tracking**
- **Purchasing**: Time sheets and expense management
- **Point of Sale (POS)**: E-commerce and inventory management to track sales
- **Sales Tracking**: Comprehensive sales management solutions

### 6. Simulation and Modeling

Research computers make it easier to create simulations and models. You can:
- **Create Simulated Environments**: Have an agent in that environment and measure parameters like temperature and pressure
- **Test Survival**: Find out if someone can survive in that environment by measuring parameters over time
- **Cost Savings**: If simulations work out, you can replicate in the actual environment, helping save costs
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Test your hypothesis and save costs through computer simulation

You simulate environments in computers, collect parameters, then replicate in real life.

### 7. Social Media Analysis

Computers can help you do social media analysis. For example:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Push a post to Facebook or LinkedIn and analyze people's reactions
- **Engagement Analysis**: Computer analysis might tell you about likes, shares, and responses to posts
- **Reaction Measurement**: Analyze whether posts generate positive or negative responses

Social media analysis helps you understand public sentiment and engagement patterns.

## Impact and Summary

The application of computers in social research and social administration has transformed the way we:
- **Collect Data**: Electronically through online surveys and forms
- **Analyze Data**: Using software packages and statistical tools
- **Manage Data**: Through databases, whether local or cloud-based
- **Collaborate**: Share results with peers and make decisions

These applications have:
- **Increased Efficiency**: Better data collection time and improved quality
- **Enhanced Quality**: Quality checks and expanded research possibilities
- **Improved Collaboration**: Whatever results you get, you can send to your peers for review and decision-making
