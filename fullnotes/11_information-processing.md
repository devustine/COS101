# Information Processing and Its Roles in Society

## Definition of Information Processing

Information processing refers to the series of activities or operations performed on data or information to transform it into a meaningful form, extract useful insights, and make informed decisions. The key words here are: series of activities performed on data or information to transform it into something you are able to understand and digest. At the end, you extract meaningful insights and make decisions.

## Example: Teacher Grading Process

Imagine if you're a teacher and your students have just written exams. You will collect those exam scripts and mark them. Once you've marked the scores, they are entered into an Excel sheet, and now you have a sense of how they performed. So now you're collecting and able to generate meaningful insights. You have your Excel sheet with your data - your student scores. You begin to make sense of that data.

Once you're done with that, you begin to make informed decisions. You know those who failed and maybe based on that, you begin to make provisions such as how you would have a makeup exam. You're able to make decisions based on the data you've synthesized.

This is a typical example of information processing. It involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to generate knowledge or support various functions and tasks.

## Steps Involved in Information Processing

There are about six steps involved in information processing:

### 1. Input
You need to get your data here. Data is entered and can be in the form of sensor data. Maybe you have a particular node or electronic device that sends data periodically and collects data from there. Data can also be collected from text, digital sources, online sources, and images. For example, you might be doing facial recognition and collecting facial images. Once you're done with input, you've been able to collect and source your data.

### 2. Storage
The next step is to store that data. Data collected can be stored in a database in a secure location.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Validation
Sometimes the data you've collected might have irrelevant data, so you can remove them. You clean that data, which means you remove irrelevant data. For example, in the exam record example, if you had to analyze students who would repeat a particular course or exam, then data such as their age might be irrelevant in making that decision. So you remove irrelevant data from what you've collected.

### 4. Data Transformation
Once you are done with cleaning, you transform that data through data transformation. You transform it into a form that will suit the receiving algorithm or application.

### 5. Analysis
Once you've transformed that data, the next step is to do some analysis. You have your statistical tools to do some analysis, and you can also use data science tools. You do analysis and try to find out how many failed this particular exam, how many passed this particular exam, and who are those at the borderline. You're able to do that analysis. For complex tasks, you would use statistical tools or data science tools.

### 6. Interpretation and Decision Making
After that, you do some interpretation and decision making. You're able to interpret that data and make sense of what that data means - how many percent will move to the next class and how many percent will not repeat this particular exam. Certain analysis would also be projected and presented.

So imagine you're a teacher and you have your analysis and interpretation. Now you know those that failed, those that passed, and those that are borderline. The next thing for you will be to do some presentation to stakeholders, the principal, and other teachers in your school. You're able to make projections using graphs or charts.

## Information Processing and Its Roles in Society

Information processing affects society in several areas:

### 1. Decision Making and Problem Solving

Information processing has been useful in problem solving. For example, government agencies use information processing to analyze current traffic information and then use such information to create better traffic management.

Sometimes data is collected about students out of school in a particular area. Once this data is collected, government agencies will use that data to analyze it. At the end of the analysis, they will determine that they need to build a school in this region because they've seen that there are lots of out-of-school children in that locality.

For traffic management, government agencies use information processing to analyze current traffic information and then use such information to create better traffic management. You have a particular area where you spend close to three or four hours in traffic, and gradually you have that data being collected. That information can also be used by government officials and corporate agencies to build road networks such that they're able to reduce the traffic on that path and mitigate the traffic problem at that place.

Again, information is collected, government officials will analyze that data, and once that analysis is carried out, they will use that to make a decision. A decision could be to create an overhead bridge or make an alternative route so that they are able to mitigate the problem at hand.

### 2. Knowledge Creation and Sharing

The development and transmission of knowledge are aided by information processing. New insights and discoveries are produced through information inquiry, analysis, and synthesis, leading to breakthroughs in a variety of subjects and disciplines.

A typical example here is COVID-19. When COVID-19 emerged, researchers and scientists tried to understand how it damages the human body. They went into research and collected data from those affected by COVID-19. Data were collected and analyzed, and the outcome was shared by researchers. This gave researchers the opportunity to research potential drugs that could combat COVID-19.

The whole process involves information processing playing a significant role. For example, the discovery of drugs to combat COVID-19 and tuberculosis was made possible through information processing and analysis.

Here, you can see a researcher collecting data. Once done with that data, they begin to analyze and interpret it. That data will also be shared with other researchers, and from there they begin to create or manufacture drugs because they now understand the nature of COVID-19. They know the features and characteristics, and for that reason, they're able to design drugs that can combat COVID-19.

### 3. Communication and Collaboration

Information processing technologies allow for smooth interpersonal and intergroup communication and collaboration. They make it easier for people to collaborate on projects, share information, and exchange ideas, which promotes innovation and advances various courses.

For example, real-time information processing has enabled the emergence of collaboration applications such as Zoom and Cisco WebEx. We now have information processing technologies like Zoom, Cisco WebEx, and Google as well. Here you can sit down and, because of these information processing technologies, you can collaborate and have information moving from a particular person through the internet and computer down to your remote location. That information is processed, analyzed, and projected onto your computer, and you're able to see the person at the other end. It's that information processing that has enabled us to collaborate with researchers.

We have interpersonal collaboration and intergroup collaboration. Not only that, you're also able to reach out to people remotely, virtually, and even send friends and family members well wishes using information processing technologies.

We also have different information processing technologies - all of them have Zoom, JIRA for meetings, Slack for collaboration, and you can see what is happening here. Different groups have conversations, and conferences discuss particular topics. Thanks to information processing technologies.

### 4. Education and Learning

Information processing plays a critical role in learning and education. New insights are generated as a result of data analysis, which contributes to knowledge and skill development. We are able to share new insights regarding COVID-19 and information about the features of COVID-19 and how it damages the human body.

That information will be shared, and we are also going to learn from it. Other researchers can also carry that on in terms of developing potential drugs that can combat COVID-19, tuberculosis, and HIV. You're able to collect data from those infected by tuberculosis or HIV.

Once you have that data, you begin to do analysis and projections. Now you're able to help understand how that damage is remembered. From there, other researchers can also take that forward to come up with solutions and drugs that can combat the diseases mentioned.

We can also view this in another way. Information processing enables us to collect resources online, materials, and help you learn and educate yourself. That data is also passed through particular infrastructure, processed, analyzed, and then the output is projected to your screen.

So, leveraging information processing technologies can also enhance education and learning as well.

### 5. Economic Impacts

Information processing is a driving force behind economic growth and productivity. Businesses leverage information to improve operational efficiency, market analysis, customer insights, and so on.

I have an example here. For example, information processing can predict what soil type will support yam plantation. This information could potentially increase yam production output. You're able to collect sand samples of particular sand types and take that to your laboratory for analysis.

You carry out some analysis. After you've collected that data, you may need to clean it - perhaps wash that particular soil type. You do some cleaning, add some chemicals, do some processing, and then you have the output. The output might be the soil's ability to retain water.

These are the features you're looking at - the ability to synthesize particular chemicals that will enhance productivity. From this information, you are able to project it and link it to yam production. Because you've done that analysis, you now understand the features of the output. You can apply this to yam production and tell the world that having this particular soil type would help boost yam production, which can be linked to economic impact. You're able to produce on a large scale and combat hunger in the land.

This is a typical example of how information processing can help impact the economy. The analysis and projections can also be applied to cultivation.

### 6. Healthcare and Medicine

Medical research, diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care are all aided by information processing. When a patient walks into a hospital, data is collected including vitals such as temperature, blood pressure, and other parameters. This data is analyzed by specialists in that area. After analysis, they can determine if the patient is suffering from malaria or fever.

You can also collect medical images such as scans of particular organs. These images are captured, processed, and projected digitally so that medical experts can diagnose conditions. For example, a kidney image can be analyzed by an expert who has gone through the information processing pipeline. The output is displayed in image form, and the medical expert can examine that image and make decisions, such as determining if the patient is suffering from kidney stones.

Information processing can help in healthcare and medicine. Medical images and systems can automate the diagnosis process. Rather than relying solely on medical experts, you can have computer vision applications that automate diagnosis. You can also have liver diagnosis and heart diagnosis applications.

## Information Processing Concerns

### Privacy Concerns

Information processing raises important considerations regarding privacy, data protection, and ethical use of information. Safeguarding personal information, ensuring data security, and respecting ethical principles are crucial in maintaining trust and upholding societal values.

This means that if you are in a position where you record people's data and information, you should use it ethically. You shouldn't share or link people's information to third parties. This practice is frowned upon.

### Data Security

You must ensure data security. If you have a password to your database that stores people's information and private data, that database shouldn't be shared. The password should remain private and shouldn't be known by third parties.

### Safeguarding Personal Information

How do we safeguard personal information? Collect only the necessary data for the intended purpose. For example, if you're collecting information for a bank client, it wouldn't make sense to collect the client's medical record. How would you use the medical record in a banking context?

Collect only the necessary data for the intended purpose. Measures should be put in place to protect data, such as firewalls and security gates to safeguard personal information from hackers. You should also invest in hardware and software security solutions to protect your infrastructure from hackers. Sometimes hackers use malicious software that can penetrate your network infrastructure and shut it down. We want to safeguard against that by investing in hardware and software security solutions.

### Removing Personal Identifiable Information

Sometimes you may want to use health records of individuals for research purposes. In that case, you should remove personal identifiable information. Take out names and things that can link individuals to that dataset to avoid identification.

Remove names, addresses, and other identifying information. You can then use the remaining data for your research purpose.

### Informed Consent

Individuals should be informed about how their data will be processed. Whatever you want to use that data for, you must share it with them. Individuals should be informed about how their data will be processed.

This is really important. Also, avoid sharing passwords to database infrastructure, as mentioned earlier.
