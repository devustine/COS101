# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

Imagine you have a personal assistant who can help you with your daily tasks. The assistant can understand your voice commands, perform tasks for you, and even anticipate your needs before you ask. Well, this is exactly what AI can do for us.

AI technology has come a long way in recent years and is starting to become a part of our daily lives in many ways. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI is changing the way we live and work. By the end of this lesson, you will have a better understanding of AI, its benefits, its downsides, and how it's changing the world around us.

## Definition of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that allows machines to replicate human intelligence. The process of AI requires writing programs that allow machines to learn from data and then make decisions on their own, just like humans.

## The Role of Data in AI

What is central to AI is data. Data provides the avenue for AI to learn patterns and then use the learned patterns to make predictions in different areas such as health, transportation, entertainment, and so much more. As you can see in our world today, broadly speaking, there are two types of AI: machine learning and deep learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI.

For example, it learns from data without being programmed as to how to carry out tasks, such as classification. As I mentioned earlier, data is central to AI. The more data the AI model is trained on, the better it can get at making predictions. Data exists in different forms.

They could come in the form of text, audio, video, or images. This data can also be collected from different sources. They could be collected from the web, for example, the history of items bought in a store. Data could also be collected from sensor sources on farmlands. For example, these sensors could measure and transmit soil properties. It's also important to note that data can be collected from medical records.

## Machine Learning Model Development Example

So how can one develop a machine learning model to predict if a particular student will pass the introduction to computing course?

The first task will be to collect data from previous students who had gone through the course. Data that might be collected include grades in all levels, mathematics, computer science, data processing, and total study hours per day. Once this information is collected, it is then passed into a developed machine learning model for training. In the training process, the model tries to uncover patterns from provided data. Once the training is done, the model can be tested on new data sets. In other words, the model can now predict if a student will pass or fail the introduction to computing course.

## Types of Machine Learning Models

There are mainly three kinds of machine learning models:

### 1. Supervised Model
We have a supervised model, which is one that undergoes training. This means that for each prediction it makes, it has to be trained on similar data. For example, the model regarding the possibility of a student passing is an example of a supervised approach.

### 2. Unsupervised Model
Next is an unsupervised model. This AI model does not undergo training. They discover patterns automatically. For example, an unsupervised model could be used to support anomalies in banking transactions. Given a set of transactions, an unsupervised model can support outliers.

### 3. Reinforcement Model
The last model is a reinforcement model. The model undergoes training using a reward-based system. For example, imagine an AI model learning how to play tennis. When it makes a wrong move, it's penalized. However, when it makes a right move, it's rewarded. Therefore, the system tries to get rewarded by doing things that will earn more rewards.

## Benefits of AI

What are the benefits of AI? AI has been used in many areas. For example, health, transportation, and processing.

### Healthcare
In health, AI models can assist in automated diagnosis. Medical images could be analyzed by AI models to predict a medical condition. It would also assist in identifying new drugs that could combat diseases such as cancer.

### Transportation
AI models can assist in transportation and the development of driverless cars that can spot obstacles and implement complex maneuvers. Examples include cars like Tesla.

### Manufacturing and Processing
Furthermore, in processing, AI has a place. It could be configured to spot anomalies. For example, it could spot defects in manufactured bottles on a conveyor belt.

## Downsides of AI

AI models have negative aspects as well. For example, if the training samples are not selected in a balanced way, the model might become biased in its predictions. For example, if Caucasians are more represented in a training sample than black people, the model may fail to recognize black people as humans.
