# Basic Software Applications

## What are Basic Software Applications?

Basic software applications provide fundamental functionality such as creating documents, working with data on an Excel sheet, or editing information for presentations or sending emails.

### Examples of Basic Software Applications
- **Creating documents**: Writing letters to clients, essays that you submit to your supervisor
- **Data viewing tools**: You have particular data on an Excel sheet, and after doing some cleaning, you're now viewing that data
- **Editing information for presentations**: Just like I'm doing now using PowerPoint to project this session

These are basic software applications that can help you with editing, data viewing, and other tasks.

## Spreadsheets

Users of spreadsheets can arrange, examine, and modify data in a table format. Within a spreadsheet, you have your data, and you can:
- Examine it
- Arrange it by adding or deleting columns
- Edit it
- Check if the data is correct and modify it as needed

### Spreadsheet Functionalities
Spreadsheets provide functionalities for:
- **Calculations**
- **Data validation**
- **Sorting**: You can sort your data in ascending order, descending order, or custom arrangements
- **Filtering tools**
- **Data visualization**: You can display your data through charts and graphs

#### Data Visualization Process
You can highlight particular data and select the design or display format you want - whether charts, graphs, or histograms.

### Spreadsheet Structure
A typical spreadsheet has:
- **Columns**: Like Column B and Column C
- **Data examples**: Claims services, orders, car life, and household health
- **Quantitative data**: Once you have that data, you can make projections and graphs to present to clients

Spreadsheets come in handy for this purpose.

### Microsoft Excel Example
Microsoft Excel is a typical example of a spreadsheet.

### Advanced Features
Spreadsheets also allow developers to create custom functions.

#### Custom Function Example
For example, you can create a timetable management function:
- If you're using Excel for timetable management and have selected a particular time slot (say 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM) for "Introduction to Computing"
- And another teacher tries to create a teaching slot at that same time
- The system would give a warning that the time slot has already been allocated

These are functionalities you can explore with spreadsheets, though they're advanced features.

### Popular Spreadsheet Programs

## File Compression Tools

File compression programs are used to compress or archive files and directories to make them smaller for storage or transport.

### Why Use File Compression?
Sometimes you have very large files (for example, a file size of five gigabytes) that you want to send to a client remotely over the internet. It makes sense to have file compression tools that can compress that file size to maybe one gigabyte.

### Compression and Extraction
File compression tools are also capable of extracting files from compressed archives.

#### How the Process Works
1. **Compression**: You compress the file, send it over the internet
2. **Decompression**: Once it reaches the destination, you use the same application to decompress it
3. **Access**: When you unzip the file (that's the technical term), the client will be able to access the files and they will be revealed to your clients or business partners

### Examples of File Compression Tools
- WinRAR
- 7-Zip
- WinZip

These tools help you compress files so that the file size is significantly reduced.

### Practical Email Example
Sometimes when you want to send an email with file attachments, the files could be hundreds of megabytes or even larger. You can use compression tools to:

#### File Size Reduction
- Reduce the file size from, say, a hundred megabytes down to 50 megabytes
- Further compress 50 megabytes down to 5 or 10 megabytes
- Once you've completed the compression operation, you can send it as an attachment
- At the receiving end, the attachment can be unzipped and the files will be revealed

#### Batch Compression
You can compress all your files into a particular folder. Once you finish zipping:
- You collect all the files
- Compress them
- Zip them
- Send them through the internet rather than attaching each file individually to an email
