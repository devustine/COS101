# Introduction to Hardware, Software and Computer Types

## Hardware Components

A few examples of hardware are CPU, memory storage devices, and input and output devices.

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
An integral part of the computer is the CPU, which is the brain of the computer responsible for:
- Executing instructions
- Controlling the flow of data

The CPU communicates with other components through a bus, which acts like a data highway.

### Memory (RAM)
Next is the memory or random access memory (RAM). 
- **Function**: It stores information temporarily and is essential so that the CPU can access information stored on it for processing
- **Multi-tasking**: RAM allows the CPU to run multiple programs at once
- **Performance**: The more RAM you have, the better your computer's performance will be

### Storage Devices
Let's move on to storage devices. Storage devices are examples of hardware that are typically used to store information permanently.

#### Hard Drives
Hard drives store information such as:
- Operating systems
- Files
- Videos
- Other types of data for a very long time

#### Solid State Drives (SSDs)
An alternative to traditional hard drives is solid state drives, otherwise known as SSDs.
- **Advantages**: SSDs are becoming increasingly popular due to their faster read and write speeds
- **Disadvantages**: Although they're typically more expensive

### Input Devices
Input devices allow information to flow into a computer system. Examples include:
- Keyboards
- Mice

### Output Devices
Devices that allow information to flow out of the computer system. Examples include:
- Printers
- Monitors

### Portable Hardware
Tablets, laptops, and smartphones are typical examples of portable hardware. They share the same components as desktops and laptops but are developed to be portable and lightweight.

## Software

Now it's time to discuss software.

### What is Software?
Software is a combination of code and data that provides instructions to computers on what kind of tasks to carry out.

### Types of Software
There are two types of software: system software and application software.

#### System Software
- **Definition**: System software is closer to the hardware
- **Example**: The operating system
- **Function**: The system software also creates a platform for applications to run

#### Application Software
- **Definition**: Application software is designed to perform specific tasks
- **Examples**: Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word, which typically run on your operating system

### Importance of Software
- Without software, hardware is seen as just an electronic component
- Software assigns tasks to hardware, which in turn executes them
- Without software, hardware is completely useless

## Computer Types

Next, we'll discuss computer types. Ever since computers were invented in the 1940s, they have come a long way. There are different kinds of computers designed to meet different needs. We will explore four kinds: desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and servers.

### Desktop Computers

Desktop computers are the oldest type of computers and are typically found in:
- Offices
- Schools
- Homes

#### Advantages of Desktop Computers
- Because they're stationary, they may have extra hardware devices, making them execute instructions faster than laptops
- As a result, they are used for complex tasks such as:
  - Gaming
  - Content creation
  - Graphics production

### Laptop Computers

Laptop computers are smaller compared to desktop computers and are developed to be used while mobile.

#### Benefits of Laptops
- Since most are lightweight, they are perfect for:
  - Students
  - Professionals
  - Anyone who would like to work on the go

#### Performance Considerations
- Laptops are sometimes less powerful than desktop computers, so they are typically used for less complex tasks like:
  - Web browsing
  - Video streaming

#### Modern Laptop Enhancements
However, laptops now have portable add-ons that can make them very powerful, such as external graphics cards that can help them perform demanding tasks like gaming.

### Mobile Devices

Mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, fall into this category.

#### Design Features
- They're developed for maximum convenience to be used on the go
- Carry out lightweight tasks like:
  - Sending emails
  - Playing lightweight games
  - Video streaming
  - Chatting
- Their sleek designs allow them to easily fit into our pockets or small handbags

#### Performance
Mobile devices have less processing power when compared to other computers such as desktops.

### Servers

Lastly, servers are computers that are designed to store, process, and manage large amounts of data.

#### Server Uses
They're typically used in businesses and organizations to store and manage data such as:
- Customer information
- Employee records
- Financial data

#### Server Types
Servers can be:
- **Physical machines**: Located in data centers
- **Cloud-hosted machines**: Machines that are hosted in the cloud

## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is becoming an increasingly popular way for businesses to access server resources without having to maintain their own physical hardware.

### How Cloud Computing Works
Cloud servers are hosted by third-party providers, which means you can essentially rent computing resources from third-party providers who manage and maintain the physical infrastructure and software that make up the cloud computing environment.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
One great benefit of cloud computing is that it eliminates the burden of having to purchase and maintain your own hardware and software.

#### What You Can Do with Cloud Computing
You can leverage the infrastructure and resources of a cloud provider to:
- Run your applications
- Store and manage your databases
- Host websites
- Manage cloud-based applications
- Access numerous computing resources
