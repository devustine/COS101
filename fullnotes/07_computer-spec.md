# Computer Specifications and Choosing a Computer

## Processor (CPU)

So let's start with the first component, which is the processor. The processor determines how fast your computer processes instructions, isn't it? You want your application to run really fast. You want your 3D rendering to run very, very fast. You want a graphics application to render really fast.

### Why Processor Speed Matters
So you will have to pay attention to your processor specification instructions. Instructions that you want to run pretty fast could be:
- Word editing documents
- Processing game graphics in real time

So you want to process things in real time, then you have to pay attention to your processor specification.

### Multi-Core Processors
Processors can have multiple cores. And so that means you have a processor within that unit you have subunits too. So it could be:
- Three subunits
- Four subunits
- Eight subunits within a particular processor

**Objective**: The objective is to split processing or enhance performance. And so you want to render things in real time.

### How Multi-Core Processing Works
Once instructions come from your operating system, for example, that instructions are distributed among the subunits of a particular processor. For example, the Intel Core i7 processor, which has four cores.

#### Types of Instructions
Instructions could be from:
- Your animation application
- Your word editing software
- Your music
- Your videos, you watching streaming videos

Those instructions go into this processor and instructions are distributed among the subunits within a particular processor, in this case i7, which has four subunits.

### Processor Speed Measurement
So I think we discussed this earlier as the unit of a processor speed is measured in hertz. And so we mentioned this - this measurement measures the amount of instructions they can process per second. So the units of a processor speed measurement is hertz. Remember that?

#### Modern Processor Speeds
So these days, an i7 processor has a speed of about four gigahertz. Yeah, I'm sure you can imagine that speed. This means it can process about 4 billion instructions per second. That's amazing. Again, it means it can process about 4 billion instructions per second. And so that is coming from a typical i7 processor.

**Availability**: Now you have this kind of processor on laptops. You also find this kind of processor on desktops as well too, yeah.

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

So another component we're gonna be looking at is the graphical processing unit, the GPU. Yeah.

### When You Need a GPU
So when you need that, when one desires enhanced performance in terms of rendering images faster in real time, when:
- Playing games on a computer
- Doing complex graphics rendering

And you think that your normal processor wouldn't help you in that regard. Clearly you would have to use a GPU such that the rendering is done in real time.

### GPU for Data Science
And the GPU was also needed to, if you're gonna be doing some deep learning. So for those in data science, you're doing some training and things like that to enhance or to make it faster to make the training faster. I mean to make it go faster, clearly you can also use the GPU to enhance the training process.

### Who Needs a GPU
Yeah, so a GPU, basically if you're:
- Data science, you wanna bring some deep learning training
- Those who are also into games, graphics rendering and things like that

Then a GPU is for you.

### GPU Physical Features
And so that's how the GPU looks like. You can see it has got fans to blow out the heat emanating from that device. And so have that. And yeah, so this GPU naturally sits on the motherboard. Yeah, so remember the motherboard where you have all that components of the computer. So this would also sit on that motherboard. Earlier I mentioned that you will have a CPU, you have the hard disk, the power supply on the motherboard. So this would also sit on the motherboard.

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

For a computer system, the next component we're gonna be looking at is RAM. Yeah.

### Why RAM is Important
So you want to run applications concurrently, want to:
- Watch films
- Do some editing
- Transfer files to a particular location
- Download files

You want all tasks and that depends on your RAM.

### How RAM Works
The RAM holds information temporarily. We mentioned this, once you shut your computer, the information stored on the RAM will be lost. The ability to run different applications at the same time lies within the RAM.

#### Applications That Use RAM
These areas, different applications, isn't it? And what:
- Editing
- Playing games
- Doing some file transfer
- Doing some file download

All rely heavily on your RAM.

### RAM Capacity Measurement
So the RAM capacity is measured in gigabytes. Yeah. So, and you have this question for you that says how many bytes?

**Question for you**: How many bytes make up one bit? So that's for you, go and do your research. And once you're done, I mean we would like to see your output.

### Modern RAM Sizes
And so RAM is really important. If you want to work on different applications at the same time, you'll have to pick a RAM size that is... we'll see that in the next slide. And so modern RAM size goes between eight gigabytes to 32 gigabytes.

#### 32 Gigabytes RAM
So that's a lot. If you have 32 gigabytes of real memory, you could:
- Do some video editing
- Download
- Load
- Watch films
- Stream films

And you still have, I mean you have all of these done in real time. Yeah.

#### 8 Gigabytes RAM
So your eight gigabytes would also suffice. Yeah. So maybe this would work close to real time being working on say three to four applications. Yeah, so it's not bad having that amount of RAM size.

#### Recommended RAM for Specific Tasks
But clearly if you are into:
- Animation
- Graphics
- Games development

Then clearly you would have to fight around a RAM size between eight gigabytes and 32 gigabytes, that could be 16 gigabytes. Having 32 gigabytes would also give you that comfort to run several applications.

### RAM Storage Capacity
So an eight gigabyte RAM can retain a maximum of 8 billion bytes. That's a lot.

**Question for you**: What maximal operation impacts? Again, this is a way for you, I mean go and do your research and once you're done with that, we would like to see your outputs. Yeah. So that's about RAM.

## Hard Disk Storage

Yeah. So also look at hard disk. The hard disk space determines how much information you want to store permanently. Yeah.

### What You Store on Hard Disk
So you want to store:
- Video files
- Images taken years back
- Different kinds of files
- Audio files
- Video files

And you want to store them. How many on your hard disk? Clearly you would have to pay attention to your hard disk size. You pay attention to store large files. So, and different file categories on your computer. Then you will have to pay attention to your hard disk.

### Hard Disk Size Measurement
Hard disk size is also measured in gigabytes as well, like RAM. And each gigabyte hard disk can hold a maximum of about 8 billion bytes. That's a lot.

**Question for you**: What is one terabyte? What maximum amount in bytes can it contain? Yeah, so question is for you, go do your research and would like to see your output as well on this one.

### Types of Hard Disks
And you have another question for you. So that is typical hard disk. Remember there are two kinds. The first one has a movable head and it uses that movable head to retrieve information from a disc. So it can read more from the disc, store more information also writes information to the disc. That's a disc. And that's why they call it hard disc.

**Practical Question**: And that's a disk that, yeah. So this question is for you, Musa, a graphics artist who enjoys 3D animation wants to get a computer he needs to travel to his clientele, who are based in Nigeria. The question here says, what brand of computer and what would the company specifications be for Musa? This is something you'll have to look into, do your research, come up with computer specification for Musa.

## Monitor Specifications

You also have the monitor too. Yeah.

### Why Monitor Size Matters
So if you're into:
- Software development
- Games development

You need a screen that is really wide so that you're able to sectionalize, isn't it? The monitor specification is also another consideration.

### Benefits for Developers and Designers
For game developers, software developers, those in animation and graphic designers, a wider screen may be an advantage. And just like I said to you, there are times you want to sectionalize your partition, your auditor.

#### Practical Use Cases
Having a bigger screen partition while they have, I mean at this partition:
- You're running your application
- At the other partition too you are also, and we're trying to see the outcome output of the code you wrote earlier

#### Game Development Example
So even in games to imagine you're developing your games could be:
- You're developing your games in one section and using game software application
- Software helps you develop two details or you're using your Unity game engine that you need to give the application and software. Yeah, that helps and develops 3D games

So you're doing that and while you're developing your game, you'll also want to see the outputs. So you can ensure the monitor and verify that you write your code, you run your code. And at the other section, you're able to run and see.

### Screen Resolution Benefits
And so that's another concentration for those who would be doing some software developing or animating and things like that. Yeah. So a wider screen typically allows for higher screen resolution. You want to see the output of an animated work and see with that resolution, we want to see how it looks.

#### Image Quality
And I'm sure clearly you also will want to see it. And we come out clearly as a higher screen resolutions provide sharper, have more detailed images as you have a wider monitor. And because you have that now you're able to see things clearly and sharper as well too with more details.

### Monitor Pixels
Yeah. So have this one, the monitor pixel cells. The more pixel cells on the monitor, the sharper the images would appear. So those are dots on your monitor. Those dots are called pixels. So the more pixels on the monitor, the sharper the image would appear.

**Example**: An example, monitor resolutions are usually in the format 1920 by 1080 pixels, you know, so you do the math and that will give you the number of pixels you have on a computer system.

## Battery Life (For Laptops)

Yeah. So battery life is another consideration especially for laptops.

### Importance of Battery Life
Battery life is an essential ingredient. The ability to work remotely without your system being plugged to a power source for a long time may be an advantage. And so you want to work on a project and for that reason, you'll need a battery life that will support your activities while you are on the move.

#### Mobile Work Scenarios
Yeah. And so, I mean, could be:
- You're developing software
- You are also doing some graphics tasks that will require you to be on the move

Moving from one location to the other as well.

### Battery Solutions
That reason your battery should be something you should consider and maybe you could also get another extra battery. That means you have, in addition to the one that comes with the laptop, you also have an extra battery and that would give you maybe six hours of work. And so the first would give you three hours and then the second would also give you three hours.

### When to Consider Battery Life
And so something you would also have to consider if you are always on the move. Moving from one place to another and while you're moving around also want to carry out some tasks, clearly you'll have to consider the battery life.

### Factors Affecting Battery Life
Yeah. So battery life can vary widely depending on factors like:
- The size of the battery
- Power consumption
- Usage

#### High-Consumption Tasks
So for tasks such as:
- Animation
- Graphics
- 3D rendering

These tasks could deplete the battery life. And so maybe you can also get one more just like I mentioned earlier. I mean this battery can take you for depending on what you're doing. Imagine you're doing some graphic work. So this, I mean that would consume so much battery. And for that reason, maybe that will last for just one hour, so that you will have to get another extra battery pack will push you for another one hour.

#### Low-Consumption Tasks
A battery life may last longer for low level tasks such as:
- Word processing
- Checking emails

So if what you do is check emails to respond to emails, to respond to queries for emails then battery life will last longer.

## Computer Types and Recommendations

### High-End Laptops

So we're looking at laptop configurations that suit you. High-end laptops are suitable for:
- Software developers
- Animators
- Graphic designers

You can have a laptop that also has dedicated GPU capacity for real-time rendering.

#### High-End Laptop Specifications
A higher-end laptop would have:
- **RAM size**: 32 gigabytes
- **Hard drive**: One TB hard drive
- **Processor**: i7 processor with a GPU

So if you want to do some animation work, software development, or data science, then this specification is for you. And that's a typical example of a high-end laptop. So if you are always on the move.

### Low-End Laptops

As an English language editor, a low-end laptop might be appropriate for you. So you don't need a GPU in your laptop to do some editing on your laptop.

#### Low-End Laptop Specifications
And so in that case, you want typically something that could be better:
- **RAM size**: About eight gigabytes

Let's say eight gigabytes - the one we saw earlier was about 32 gigabytes. So a RAM size of about eight gigabytes should work or even less as a typical example of a low-end laptop.

#### Suitable Tasks for Low-End Laptops
Yeah. So typically, not only for basic tasks, but what you do is just:
- Watch films
- Listen to music on your laptop
- Check your emails
- Respond to emails and things like that

So a low-end laptop will be appropriate in that case.

### Desktop Computers

Desktop computers might suit you. High-end desktops are suitable for:
- Software developers
- Animators
- Graphic designers
- Data scientists

In this case, you are not on the move. You have, imagine you have a place where you go to your office and you don't move around that much. And so a desktop with this capacity would suit you.

#### High-End Desktop Specifications
A high-end desktop would have typical specifications:
- Brand name
- One terabyte hard disk drive space
- i7 processor or a GPU

So in this case you're not moving around, you just use your particular application and you're doing your work. It's a typical desktop example.

#### Low-End Desktop Specifications
And so that's how it looks like. Yeah. So for basic office work such as:
- Sending emails
- Video conferencing
- Browsing the internet

A low-end desktop will be appropriate. So you don't need to spend so much buying high-end desktops.

##### Low-End Desktop Components
Low-end desktop equipment doesn't need a GPU. So you can get a low-end computer that could have:
- **CPU**: An i5 or i3 CPU rating, maybe an i5 or i3, just for sending emails, doing some video conferencing, and it'll also browse internet
- **RAM**: Maybe eight gigabytes of RAM size would work

Yeah. So, but if at the same time you want to store more information, you would also have to be mindful of your hard disk size. So maybe going for one terabyte hard disk size, but you have to consider storing files, office files, his videos, documents, office documents and things like that. Yeah. So, and these are documents you might draw for a very long period of time. And so you have to consider your hard disk for that low-end option that might suit you.

### Server Computers

And so servers too. So if you would like to host applications that require real-time processing, then a server might be appropriate.

#### When You Need a Server
And so imagine you develop a web application and you want to host it and your own server. And so, and you also want your clients to request information or request resources from that application you developed in real-time. And so you need to buy a server for that, and that server will host your application.

#### Server Specifications
Your application looks like something way bigger than a typical desktop. It looks like there's so much processing speed and hard disk space. So you can have:
- **Hard disk space**: Five terabytes, things like that
- **Processor**: The processor too would also be beyond i7, could be i9. You could have so much different core units within that processor

And such that it's going to run in real-time. And so you have clients requesting from different locations, perhaps around the globe. So, and you want to serve them in real-time and so that you know you need a server in that case.

#### Server Use Case
You develop an application and you want to host it. And you also need real-time response. You want your application to respond in real-time to your clients. In that case a server would be appropriate. Yeah.

### Mobile Devices

So mobile devices might also suit you if you would like to be on mobile, checking emails, browsing the internet as well as doing some video conferencing. Then the mobile device, right? Or a tablet would work.

#### Suitable Tasks for Mobile Devices
So all you're doing really is to:
- Check internet
- Respond and reach people's requests
- Respond to people's notes
- Do some social networking when you are online - social networking applications such that you're able to respond to queries from clients in that social media space

If that is what you do, then a mobile device would suit you.
