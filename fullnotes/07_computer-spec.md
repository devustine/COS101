# Computer Specifications and Choosing a Computer - Session 4

## Introduction
Hi everyone and welcome to session four. In this session you're going to be discussing computer specifications and choosing a computer.

## Learning Objectives
I'll run you through the learning objectives, but first is to discuss different types of computer specifications and also to outline the factors to consider when choosing a computer. And lastly, to analyze the role of RAM in a computer system. And so we'll shed light on choosing the right computer phase on its major components and would also look at computer types within the context of hardware specifications.

## Processor (CPU)
So let's start with the first component, which is the processor. The processor determines how fast your computer processes instructions, isn't it? You want your application to run really fast. You want your 3D rendering to run very, very fast. You want a graphics application to render really fast.

So you will have to pay attention to your processor specification instructions. Instructions that you want to run pretty fast could be word editing documents, processing game graphics in real time. So you want to process things in real time, then you have to pay attention to your processor specification.

Processors can have multiple cores. And so that means you have a processor within that unit you have subunits too. So it could be three subunits, four subunits, eight subunits within a particular processor. The objective is to split processing or enhance performance. And so you want to render things in real time.

Once instructions come from your operating system, for example, that instructions are distributed among the subunits of a particular processor. For example, the Intel Core i7 processor, which has four cores.

Instructions could be from your animation application, from your word editing software, from your music, from your videos, you watching streaming videos. Those instructions go into this processor and instructions are distributed among the subunits within a particular processor, in this case i7, which has four subunits.

So I think we discussed this earlier as the unit of a processor speed is measured in hertz. And so we mentioned this - this measurement measures the amount of instructions they can process per second. So the units of a processor speed measurement is hertz. Remember that? So these days, an i7 processor has a speed of about four gigahertz.

Yeah, I'm sure you can imagine that speed. This means it can process about 4 billion instructions per second. That's amazing. Again, it means it can process about 4 billion instructions per second. And so that is coming from a typical i7 processor.

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
And so that's right. Looks like your i7 processor. Now you have this kind of processor on laptops. You also find this kind of processor on desktops as well too, yeah. So another component we're gonna be looking at is the graphical processing unit, the GPU. Yeah. So when you need that, when one desires enhanced performance in terms of rendering images faster in real time, when playing games on a computer or when doing complex graphics rendering.

And you think that your normal processor wouldn't help you in that regard. Clearly you would have to use a GPU such that the rendering is done in real time and the GPU was also needed to, if you're gonna be doing some deep learning.

So for those in data science, you're doing some training and things like that to enhance or to make it faster to make the training faster. I mean to make it go faster, clearly you can also use the GPU to enhance the training process.

Yeah, so a GPU, basically if you're data science, you wanna bring some deep learning training and for those who are also into games, graphics rendering and things like that, then a GPU is for you. And so that's how the GPU looks like.

You can see it has got fans to blow out the heat emanating from that device. And so have that. And yeah, so this GPU naturally sits on the motherboard. Yeah, so remember the motherboard where you have all that components of the computer. So this would also sit on that motherboard. Earlier I mentioned that you will have a CPU, you have the hard disk, the power supply on the motherboard. So this would also sit on the motherboard.

## RAM (Random Access Memory)
For a computer system, the next component we're gonna be looking at is RAM. Yeah. So you want to run applications concurrently, want to watch films, you want to do some editing. You also want to transfer files to a particular location.

You also want to download files. You want all tasks and that depends on your RAM. The RAM holds information temporarily. We mentioned this, once you shut your computer, the information stored on the RAM will be lost. The ability to run different applications at the same time lies within the RAM. These areas, different applications, isn't it? And what editing, playing games, doing some file transfer, doing some file download relies heavily on your RAM.

So the RAM capacity is measured in gigabytes. Yeah. So, and you have this question for you that says how many bytes? And so that's a question for you. How many bytes make up one bit? So that's for you, go and do your research.

And once you're done, I mean we would like to see your output. And so RAM is really important. If you want to work on different applications at the same time, you'll have to pick a RAM size that is... we'll see that in the next slide. And so modern RAM size goes between eight gigabytes to 32 gigabytes. So that's a lot. If you have 32 gigabytes of real memory, you could do some video editing and you could download, you could load, you could also watch films. You could stream films and you still have, I mean you have all of these done in real time. Yeah. So your eight gigabytes would also suffice. Yeah.

So maybe this would work close to real time being working on say three to four applications. Yeah, so it's not bad having that amount of RAM size. But clearly if you are into animation, graphics, you are also into games development, then clearly you would have to fight around a RAM size between eight gigabytes and 32 gigabytes, that could be 16 gigabytes.

Having 32 gigabytes would also give you that comfort to run several applications. So an eight gigabyte RAM can retain a maximum of 8 billion bytes. That's a lot. What maximal operation impacts? Again, this is a way for you, I mean go and do your research and once you're done with that, we would like to see your outputs. Yeah. So that's about RAM. Yeah. So also look at hard disk.

## Hard Disk Storage
The hard disk space determines how much information you want to store permanently. Yeah. So you want to store video files, you want to store images taken years back. You want to store video files, you want to store images, you want to store different kinds of files, audio files, video files, and you want to store them. How many on your hard disk? Clearly you would have to pay attention to your hard disk size. You pay attention to store large files. So, and different file categories on your computer.

Then you will have to pay attention to your hard disk. Hard disk size is also measured in gigabytes as well, like RAM. And each gigabyte hard disk can hold a maximum of about 8 billion bytes. That's a lot. And you have another question for you.

Question says, what is one terabyte? What maximum amount in bytes can it contain? Yeah, so question is for you, go do your research and would like to see your output as well on this one. Yeah. So that is typical hard disk.

Remember there are two kinds. The first one has a movable head and it uses that movable head to retrieve information from a disc. So it can read more from the disc, store more information also writes information to the disc. That's a disc. And that's why they call it hard disc.

And that's a disk that, yeah. So this question is for you, Musa, a graphics artist who enjoys 3D animation wants to get a computer he needs to travel to his clientele, who are based in Nigeria. The question here says, what brand of computer and what would the company specifications be for Musa? This is something you'll have to look into, do your research, come up with computer specification for Musa.

## Monitor Specifications
You also have the monitor too. Yeah. So if you're into software development, you're into games development, you need a screen that is really wide so that you're able to sectionalize, isn't it? The monitor specification is also another consideration.

For game developers, software developers, those in animation and graphic designers, a wider screen may be an advantage. And just like I said to you, there are times you want to sectionalize your partition, your auditor. Having a bigger screen partition while they have, I mean at this partition you're running your application that the other partition too you are also, and we're trying to see the outcome output of the code you wrote earlier.

So even in games to imagine you're developing your games could be you're developing your games in one section and using game software application. Software helps you develop two details or you're using your Unity game engine that you need to give the application and software. Yeah, that helps and develops 3D games. Yeah. So you're doing that and while you're developing your game, you'll also want to see the outputs. So you can ensure the monitor and verify that you write your code, you run your code.

And at the other section, you're able to run and see. And so that's another concentration for those who would be doing some software developing or animating and things like that. Yeah. So a wider screen typically allows for higher screen resolution. You want to see the output of an animated work and see with that resolution, we want to see how it looks. And I'm sure clearly you also will want to see it. And we come out clearly as a higher screen resolutions provide sharper, have more detailed images as you have a wider monitor. And because you have that now you're able to see things clearly and sharper as well too with more details. Yeah. So have this one, the monitor pixel cells.

The more pixel cells on the monitor, the sharper the images would appear. So those are dots on your monitor. Those dots are called pixels. So the more pixels on the monitor, the sharper the image would appear. An example, monitor resolutions are usually in the format 1920 by 1080 pixels, you know, so you do the math and that will give you the number of pixels you have on a computer system.

## Battery Life (For Laptops)
Yeah. So battery life is another consideration especially for laptops. Battery life is an essential ingredient. The ability to work remotely without your system being plugged to a power source for a long time may be an advantage. And so you want to work on a project and for that reason, you'll need a battery life that will support your activities while you are on the move.

Yeah. And so, I mean, could be you're developing software, could be you are also doing some graphics tasks that will require you to be on the move, isn't it? Moving from one location to the other as well.

That reason your battery should be something you should consider and maybe you could also get another extra battery. That means you have, in addition to the one that comes with the laptop, you also have an extra battery and that would give you maybe six hours of work. And so the first would give you three hours and then the second would also give you three hours. And so something you would also have to consider if you are always on the move.

Moving from one place to another and while you're moving around also want to carry out some tasks, clearly you'll have to consider the battery life. Yeah. So battery life can vary widely depending on factors like the size of the battery, power consumption and usage.

So for tasks such as animation, graphics and 3D rendering, these tasks could deplete the battery life. And so maybe you can also get one more just like I mentioned earlier. I mean this battery can take you for depending on what you're doing. Imagine you're doing some graphic work. So this, I mean that would consume so much battery.

And for that reason, maybe that will last for just one hour, so that you will have to get another extra battery pack will push you for another one hour. A battery life may last longer for low level tasks such as word processing and checking emails.

So if what you do is check emails to respond to emails, to respond to queries for emails then battery life will last longer.

## Computer Types and Recommendations

### High-End Laptops
So we're looking at laptop configurations that suit you. High-end laptops are suitable for software developers, animators, and graphic designers. You can have a laptop that also has dedicated GPU capacity for real-time rendering.

A higher-end laptop would have a RAM size of 32 gigabytes, one TB hard drive, and an i7 processor with a GPU. So if you want to do some animation work, software development, or data science, then this specification is for you. And that's a typical example of a high-end laptop. So if you are always on the move.

### Low-End Laptops
As an English language editor, a low-end laptop might be appropriate for you. So you don't need a GPU in your laptop to do some editing on your laptop. And so in that case, you want typically something that could be better - a RAM size of about eight gigabytes. Let's say eight gigabytes - the one we saw earlier was about 32 gigabytes.

So a RAM size of about eight gigabytes should work or even less as a typical example of a low-end laptop. That's what you see there. Yeah. So typically, not only for basic tasks, but what you do is just watch films, listen to music on your laptop, you also check your emails, respond to emails and things like that.

So a low-end laptop will be appropriate in that case.

### Desktop Computers
Desktop computers might suit you. High-end desktops are suitable for software developers, animators, graphic designers and data scientists. In this case, you are not on the move. You have, imagine you have a place where you go to your office and you don't move around that much. And so a desktop with this capacity would suit you.

A high-end desktop would have typical specifications: brand name, one terabyte hard disk drive space, and an i7 processor or a GPU. So in this case you're not moving around, you just use your particular application and you're doing your work. It's a typical desktop example.

And so that's how it looks like. Yeah. So for basic office work such as sending emails, video conferencing, browsing the internet, a low-end desktop will be appropriate. So you don't need to spend so much buying high-end desktops.

Low-end desktop equipment doesn't need a GPU. So you can get a low-end computer that could have an i5 or i3 CPU rating, maybe an i5 or i3, just for sending emails, doing some video conferencing, and it'll also browse internet. That can work for your RAM size - maybe eight gigabytes of RAM size would work.

Yeah. So, but if at the same time you want to store more information, you would also have to be mindful of your hard disk size. So maybe going for one terabyte hard disk size, but you have to consider storing files, office files, his videos, documents, office documents and things like that. Yeah. So, and these are documents you might draw for a very long period of time. And so you have to consider your hard disk for that low-end option that might suit you.

### Server Computers
And so servers too. So if you would like to host applications that require real-time processing, then a server might be appropriate.

And so imagine you develop a web application and you want to host it and your own server. And so, and you also want your clients to request information or request resources from that application you developed in real-time. And so you need to buy a server for that, and that server will host your application.

Your application looks like something way bigger than a typical desktop. It looks like there's so much processing speed and hard disk space. So you can have hard disk space of five terabytes, things like that. Yeah. So the processor too would also be beyond i7, could be i9. You could have so much different core units within that processor and such that it's going to run in real-time. And so you have clients requesting from different locations, perhaps around the globe. So, and you want to serve them in real-time and so that you know you need a server in that case.

You develop an application and you want to host it. And you also need real-time response. You want your application to respond in real-time to your clients. In that case a server would be appropriate. Yeah.

### Mobile Devices
So mobile devices might also suit you if you would like to be on mobile, checking emails, browsing the internet as well as doing some video conferencing. Then the mobile device, right? Or a tablet would work.

So all you're doing really is to check internet, respond and reach people's requests, respond to people's notes. And you could also do some social networking when you are online - social networking applications such that you're able to respond to queries from clients in that social media space.

If that is what you do, then a mobile device would suit you.

## Summary

Yes. So in summary we've discussed different types of computer specifications and we also outlined the factors to consider when choosing a computer. And so you have the hard disk, you have the processor, you have the RAM, and you also have the GPU. So these are the main factors you have to consider when choosing the computer and also the task at hand. What task are you doing when you're developing games or what you do is just to check your news or store files and things like that. Yeah. So we also analyzed the role of RAM.

So RAM helps you to perform operations in parallel. You're doing visual editing, you also listen to audio files at the same time you're uploading a file to the internet and you're doing things in real time and in parallel to your RAM. Your RAM allows you to take out these tasks. And so thank you very much and I see you next time.
