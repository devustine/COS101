# A Brief History of Computing and Its Impact on Society

### The Abacus
Computing may be traced back to prehistoric times when humans employed machines such as the abacus to carry out mathematical computations. The abacus is a mechanical device that is used for counting. As you can see, the abacus has a wooden framework with two sections:

- **Lower section**: Has beads arranged in groups of five for counting units (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
- **Upper section**: Has beads arranged in groups for counting in fives (5, 10, 15, 20, 25), tens (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), and fifties (50, 100, etc.).

#### How to Count with an Abacus
To count nine using an abacus, you would work with the unit section and move four beads to represent 1, 2, 3, 4, then push one bead from the upper section down to represent five, giving you a total of nine beads (5, 6, 7, 8, 9). You can research how to count 50 and 501,005 using this mechanical device called the abacus.

## Vacuum Tube Computers

The first computers did not appear until the 1940s. A typical example of a computer that emerged at that time was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC), which was a general-purpose electronic computer that could be reprogrammed for different research and computational purposes.

### ENIAC Specifications
- **Developed by**: Prosper Eckert and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania.
- **Development period**: Between 1943 and 1945.
- **Components**: About 50,000 vacuum tubes in total, with approximately 17,000 tubes helping it to work properly.
- **Size**: Really huge machines that required a person to help boot up the computer.

## Transistors and Integrated Circuits

Stored-program and integrated computers were developed between the 1950s and 1970s. By replacing vacuum tubes with transistors (developed in 1947), computing technology was transformed.

### Benefits of Transistors
- Made computers smaller.
- Made computers more compact.
- Made computers more dependable.
- Made computers more effective.

### Integrated Circuits Development
The idea of integrated circuits arose in the late 1950s and early 1960s, enabling the miniaturization of several transistors and their placement on a single silicon chip. This allowed many transistors to be placed on a single silicon chip, therefore making computers much smaller compared to vacuum-based computers.

**Key Feature**: An integrated circuit contains hundreds of transistors embedded in a single chip, which replaced the vacuum-based computers.

## Personal Computers

This led to the development of personal computers. The first personal computers were developed as a result of the early 1970s microprocessor revolution.

### Evolution Timeline
- **1970s**: Researchers developed smaller microprocessors that could run faster than those developed earlier.
- **30 years later**: Many of today's computers can be found on desktops, laptops, and most recently smartphones.
- **Modern day**: Modern microprocessors contain hundreds of thousands of integrated circuits (ICs) embedded within them.

### Modern Computer Examples
- Desktops
- Laptops
- Smartphones
- Tablets

All containing microprocessors that make them smaller and more affordable.

## Impact on Various Sectors

The advent of computers and their connection to the internet has made them useful in different sectors such as education, entertainment, communication, and health.

#### COVID-19 Impact
During the COVID-19 pandemic, computers played a vital role in bringing people together despite the lockdown restrictions. During the global lockdown, when people's movement was restricted, they relied on their computers to:
- Talk to friends and family members to maintain connections.
- Check how friends were feeling.
- Stay connected during the difficult lockdown period.

### Healthcare

Computers have made significant improvements in healthcare through various applications.
