# A Brief History of Computing and Its Impact on Society

## The Abacus

Computing can be traced back to prehistoric times when humans used devices like the **abacus** to perform mathematical computations. The abacus is a mechanical device used for counting, with a wooden framework divided into two sections:

- **Lower section**: Beads arranged in groups of five for counting units (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- **Upper section**: Beads arranged for counting in fives (5, 10, 15, 20, 25), tens (10, 20, 30, etc.), and fifties (50, 100, etc.)

### How to Count with an Abacus
To count nine:
- Move four beads from the lower section to represent 1–4.
- Push one bead from the upper section down to represent 5.
- Together, this gives you a total of nine (5 + 4).

You can explore how to count numbers like 50 or 501,005 using this ancient device.

## Vacuum Tube Computers

The first computers appeared in the 1940s. A typical example was the **Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC)**, a general-purpose electronic computer that could be reprogrammed for various research and computational tasks.

### ENIAC Specifications
- **Developed by**: Prosper Eckert and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania
- **Period**: 1943–1945
- **Components**: About 50,000 vacuum tubes, with 17,000 actively operating the system
- **Size**: Extremely large, requiring human operators to boot and maintain it

## Transistors and Integrated Circuits

Between the 1950s and 1970s, stored-program computers evolved. The invention of the **transistor** in 1947 replaced vacuum tubes, transforming computing technology.

### Benefits of Transistors
- Made computers smaller
- Made them more compact and dependable
- Increased efficiency and reliability

### Development of Integrated Circuits (ICs)
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, integrated circuits allowed multiple transistors to be placed on a single silicon chip. This drastically reduced computer size while increasing performance.

**Key Feature**: Integrated circuits contain hundreds of transistors embedded on a single chip, replacing bulky vacuum-tube-based systems.

## Personal Computers

These advancements led to the creation of **personal computers** in the 1970s, driven by the microprocessor revolution.

### Evolution Timeline
- **1970s**: Development of smaller, faster microprocessors
- **30 years later**: Desktops, laptops, and eventually smartphones became commonplace
- **Modern day**: Microprocessors now house hundreds of thousands of ICs

### Modern Examples
- Desktops
- Laptops
- Smartphones
- Tablets
