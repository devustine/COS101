# A Brief History of Computing and Its Impact on Society

## Early Computing History

Computing may be traced back to prehistoric times when humans employed machines such as the abacus to carry out mathematical computations. The abacus is a mechanical device that is used for counting. As you can see, the abacus has a wooden framework with two sections. The lower section has beads arranged in groups of five for counting units (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), while the upper section has beads arranged in groups for counting in fives (5, 10, 15, 20, 25), tens (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), and fifties (50, 100, etc.).

To count nine using an abacus, you would work with the unit section and move four beads to represent 1, 2, 3, 4, then push one bead from the upper section down to represent five, giving you a total of nine beads (5, 6, 7, 8, 9). You can research how to count 50 and 501,005 using this mechanical device called the abacus.

## Vacuum Tube Computers

The first computers did not appear until the 1940s. A typical example of a computer that emerged at that time was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC), which was a general-purpose electronic computer that could be reprogrammed for different research and computational purposes. It was developed by Prosper Eckert and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania between 1943 and 1945. It housed about 50,000 vacuum tubes, which was really huge. As you can see in the image, there are vacuum tubes running throughout the machine, with approximately 17,000 tubes helping it to work properly. There was even a person trying to boot up the computer, demonstrating just how massive these early machines were.

## Transistors and Integrated Circuits

Stored-program and integrated computers were developed between the 1950s and 1970s. By replacing vacuum tubes with transistors (developed in 1947), computing technology was transformed. This made computers smaller, more compact, dependable, and effective thanks to these transistors, which are smaller components that make computers more efficient.

The idea of integrated circuits arose in the late 1950s and early 1960s, enabling the miniaturization of several transistors and their placement on a single silicon chip. This allowed many transistors to be placed on a single silicon chip, therefore making computers much smaller compared to vacuum-based computers. As you can see from examples of integrated circuit computers manufactured between the 1950s and 1970s, the vacuum tubes were no longer present and were replaced by integrated circuits. An integrated circuit contains hundreds of transistors embedded in a single chip, which replaced the vacuum-based computers.

## Personal Computers

This led to the development of personal computers. The first personal computers were developed as a result of the early 1970s microprocessor revolution. During the 1970s, researchers developed smaller microprocessors that could run faster than those developed earlier. Fast forward thirty years, and many of today's computers can be found on desktops, laptops, and most recently smartphones, all designed to make our computers smaller and faster. Modern microprocessors contain hundreds of thousands of integrated circuits (ICs) embedded within them. We now have examples of modern computers including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, all containing microprocessors that make them smaller and more affordable.

## Impact on Various Sectors

### Education
The advent of computers and their connection to the internet has made them useful in different sectors such as education, entertainment, communication, and health. Computers have enhanced education significantly. Today, you can sit before your computer and access resources through internet connectivity, accessing information from different servers whether on the cloud or standing servers. You can access materials and videos online, and this has helped enhance literacy levels, especially in remote places where educational institutions are not accessible. In remote areas where you won't find universities or educational tools, you can use your computer and internet connection to learn. People can learn various skills, from riding bicycles to driving cars, through online resources.

You can conduct personal study, access books remotely, attend online classes, carry out experiments on your computer, run code simulations, create 3D graphics, and collaborate with colleagues across the globe using your computer.

### Communication
Computers have also enhanced communication through text messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, and Facebook, enabling instant communication across distances. These technologies have made it possible for people to connect across the globe more easily than ever before. You can sit before your computer and use WhatsApp to communicate with friends, or use Zoom to connect with friends remotely in the US or Europe. You can also collaborate with researchers, have online meetings, and participate in various activities effortlessly because of computers.

You can have conversations with friends across the globe and collaborate on research topics or learn from each other. This is all possible because we have computers and widespread internet connectivity. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, computers played a vital role in bringing people together despite the lockdown restrictions. During the global lockdown, when people's movement was restricted, they relied on their computers to talk to friends and family members to maintain connections. People had to rely on technologies like Zoom and Cisco WebEx to communicate, launching these applications on their computers to check how friends were feeling and stay connected during the difficult lockdown period.

### Healthcare
Computers have made it possible to view digital images such as organ scans for objective diagnosis. With computers, scans of organs can be taken and digitized, allowing medical professionals to view them on computer systems for accurate diagnosis. Additionally, these digital images can be sent to medical experts across the globe for collaboration. Even if you don't have medical experts at your local facility, you can use your computer to send diagnostic images to experts anywhere in the world. These experts can examine the images, provide analysis, and send back objective diagnoses. 

Computers have also made remote surgeries possible, where medical experts across the globe can guide surgical procedures remotely, thanks to computer technology and internet connectivity.

### Entertainment
Computers have also enhanced entertainment significantly. Because computers can process instructions very quickly, they are useful for playing games and watching movies. You can use applications on your mobile phone or computer to watch your favorite series, movies, or local content depending on your preferences. You can also play games with friends across the globe - for example, if you're in Nigeria and have friends in the US or Europe, you can connect with them and play games online together. Thanks to the internet and computer technology, it's now possible to play games with friends thousands of miles apart from the comfort of your home. You can play FIFA and other categories of games, all made possible by computer technology.

## Ethical Implications and Challenges
