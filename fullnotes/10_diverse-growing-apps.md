# Diverse and Growing Competitive Digital Applications

## What Are Digital Applications?

Diverse and growing competitive digital applications are software programs and digital tools that encompass various domains and serve different purposes. Examples that we're going to discuss include:

- Learning management systems
- Cloud storage and file sharing applications
- Version control applications
- Design and creativity tools

## Learning Management Systems (LMS)

Learning management systems are platforms that support the administration, distribution, tracking, and management of educational courses. These systems typically allow you to:

### Content Creation and Distribution
- Upload learning materials online
- Create work documents or PowerPoint presentations
- Push content to the software learning management system
- Students can retrieve tutorial files, session files, and class files for live sessions

### Assessment and Evaluation
- Set questions and quizzes for students
- Automatically mark objective-type exams and tests
- Manually grade essays and subjective assessments
- Send results to both students and tutors
- Support administration and track student progress

### Interactive Features
- Chat functionality for topic discussions and media discussions
- Student-lecturer communication through chat sessions
- Result management systems that distribute quiz results to designated sections

### File Management
- Edit and manage uploaded files
- Create class files and session documents
- Distribute materials to students who log into the platform

## Example: Moodle Learning Management System

Moodle is a popular learning management system used in many universities in Africa and European countries. It's a robust software that tracks files and has extensive functionality embedded in it.

### Moodle Features:
- **Homepage with course listings** - Geography, History, and other courses
- **File upload capabilities** - Add files to specific courses and sessions
- **Chat sessions** - Shows number of persons online
- **Upcoming events section** - Keep track of scheduled activities
- **Private files area**
- **Calendar integration**
- **Administration section** - Create blogs and manage content
- **Material management** - Upload and organize course materials within different compartments

## Cloud Storage and File Sharing Applications

When you want to work on a file and need partners to edit that file and make comments, you push the file to the cloud so they can retrieve it from anywhere and work on it.

### Key Benefits:
- **Collaboration** - Multiple users can edit, review, and make adjustments
- **Storage facility** - Push and access files in real-time
- **Cross-device accessibility** - Access from different devices
- **High uptime** - Secure files with nearly 100% uptime
- **Versatile file support** - PowerPoint files, work documents, code files, and more

### Popular Cloud Storage Services:
- **Google Drive**
- **Dropbox**
- **Microsoft OneDrive**
- **Box**
- **iCloud Drive**
- **Amazon Drive** (and other services)

### How Cloud Storage Works:
1. Create an account with the chosen service
2. Access different facilities and storage options
3. Drag and drop files from your desktop directly to the platform
4. Files are automatically saved to the cloud drive
5. Anyone with access can retrieve and download files
6. Collaborate on documents in real-time

## Version Control Systems (VCS)

Version control applications are software tools designed to track and manage modifications made to files. They are often referred to as version control systems or source code management systems.

### Purpose in Software Development:
- Track different versions of software during development
- Manage collaborative development among multiple developers
- Enable rollback to previous versions if current version doesn't work optimally

### How Version Control Works:
1. **Version One** - Initial software version
2. **Version Two** - Modified version with tweaks and error corrections  
3. **Version Three** - Further improvements and updates
4. **Version Management** - VCS manages all changes made over time
5. **Rollback Capability** - Ability to return to earlier versions if needed

### VCS Benefits:
- **Developer Communication** - Enable team collaboration
- **Code Sharing** - Promote collaborative development
- **Change Monitoring** - Tools for monitoring and contrasting emerging changes
- **File Management** - Help manage software files rather than run applications

### Example: Git
Git is a typical example of a version control application. You push your software code (not the running version) to the platform, and the system helps you manage the files and track modifications made by different team members.

### Git - Advanced Version Control Features

Git is a great example of version control software that can help you manage files. It's not a platform for running your application, but it can help you manage those files attributed to your software.

Git is a distributed version control system widely used for managing and tracking changes in software development projects. When you have a particular version that you modify, and you want to merge changes, if the latest version doesn't work optimally, then you can quickly roll back to an earlier version.

The speed, scalability, and flexibility of Git as a distributed version control system are well recognized, making it popular among software developers. If you aspire to be a software developer, you should clearly have knowledge of Git and understand how it helps you track changes. It enables several developers to work freely and concurrently on a project, effortlessly integrating their modifications.

### Collaborative Development with Git

Git allows for global collaboration where you can have software developers in Nigeria working with developers in the US and Europe. Once you access Git, you can collect a project, work on that project, and once you've completed your modifications, you can push back to Git. Git helps you merge those changes and progress to version two of that particular software.

In the event that the latest version gives errors, you can immediately roll back to an earlier version. Git's homepage allows you to receive different people collaborating, collect particular versions of code, and track those changes as well.

## Mobile Applications

Mobile applications are available in different categories for smartphones and tablets. These categories include:

### Productivity Applications
- Calendar applications
- Task management tools
- Note-taking applications

### Entertainment Applications
- Movie streaming (Nigerian movies, Indian movies, local movies, American movies)
- Gaming applications
- Media consumption tools

### Health and Fitness Applications
- Step tracking applications
- Health monitoring tools that keep track of various metrics
- Integration with wearable devices like smartwatches

### Wearable Device Integration
Smartwatches can track your blood pressure, and that data can be collected over a period of time. When you synchronize your watch with your phone, the data collected over time will be downloaded into your fitness application, allowing you to track your health metrics for days, weeks, or months.

### Financial Applications
Different mobile apps are available for various banks, not only Nigerian banks but also international banks. These applications allow you to:
- Send money to friends and family
- Make payments and transfers
- Borrow money
- Track money transactions
- Trade and access various financial services
