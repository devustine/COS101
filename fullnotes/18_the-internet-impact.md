# The Internet: Applications and Impacts

## Global Communication and Information Sharing

Global communication and information sharing has been made possible via the internet. Because computers are connected through internet connections and different connections, information can flow from one space to another. This could be from Google servers to your system. Then you can access files from Google servers, and that is returned to you through the internet.

It's now possible to share information, videos, documents, spreadsheets, Google Forms, and more because of the internet. You can have your mobile device, laptop, or desktop and request information from your mobile device to particular services like e-commerce applications. You have that response sent to you because of the internet.

## Impact on Society and Culture

The internet has impacted our society and culture. You can watch YouTube videos and learn about other people's cultures. It has impacted our society and the way we live. People can log into e-commerce applications and shop online, buying things online instead of going to physical facilities. This has also improved our economy.

You can work remotely because there's internet. You can sit at the comfort of your laptop in your house and begin to make money, working remotely and improving your economy and areas of life. You can go to YouTube and learn about other people's cultures.

You can also invite software developers to develop code and send whatever you've developed to a server. For example, software for fashion management that tracks changes. When developing, you send your code, and you have another developer that sits elsewhere and develops. You can work remotely and collaborate remotely, thanks to the internet.

## Information Access and Communication

The internet has really impacted information access. You can go online on your mobile, tablet, desktop, or laptop and access information online. Not only that, you can also communicate. You have your computer and from your computer you can launch your Zoom application and communicate with friends across the globe. It's possible and also possible to buy things online.

You have lots of e-commerce applications and software, so you can log in and buy things because computers are connected. You can do your online shopping. You can also network and do social media - go on LinkedIn, make videos, push them to LinkedIn, push to Facebook. People begin to get likes and comments as well.

That's possible because of the internet. You can also do online entertainment - it's possible to watch movies, watch series online. You can also play games with friends across the globe. You're here in Nigeria and a friend in the US - you can play games and collaborate, thanks to the internet.

## Learning and Education

You can learn using online resources. You can log in and learn, begin to educate yourself. That's possible. The internet enables work and productive activities as well.

### Educational Benefits:
- **Virtual Classrooms**: You can have virtual classrooms enabled by Zoom. You can have a Zoom class where you have 101,000 participants with a lecturer. That is possible because of the internet.
- **Educational Resources**: You can look at educational resources, books, electronic books, libraries, and electronic libraries you can visit. Then you can also get books and learn.
- **Accessibility**: Education has become more open to all people and is now more flexible to access. There are places that you may not find physical schools in remote areas. Then you can set up a virtual school. Once you have the internet and your resources, you can have someone lecture who logs in remotely.
- **Online Learning Platforms**: You can look at sites like Udemy where they learn virtually. They don't need physical presence to learn. You can do research, get resources online, or listen to recorded videos just to learn more or to augment what you've learned previously.

## Internet of Things (IoT)

It's also possible to have IoT devices - Internet of Things. These are embedded systems. For example, you might have a small chip attached to the human body that can measure pressure, blood pressure, and temperature. You have that device attached to you, and periodically that information is sent to a server. If there are spikes in your pulse, it measures pulse for example, then that means there's a problem. That's a red flag. Then maybe the system can automatically call the doctor and then you're saved - that's an example of an IoT device.

You can also have IoT devices in homes as well.

## Privacy and Security Concerns

Because we have computers connected to the internet, you might have malicious users or hackers who sit on computers and begin to write codes that can be sent to the internet to shut down your infrastructure. That's a concern.

### Security Challenges:
- **Data Privacy**: Someone might have access to your data and begin to change its format. That's a problem because you have computers connected and presence of the internet.
- **Online Fraud**: You have online fraud. Someone can retrieve credit card details and use them to their own advantage.
- **Cybersecurity Threats**: Hackers can write codes and send them to the internet, which might shut down your infrastructure so that your clients won't have access to your software.
- **Data Exploitation**: There's the possibility of people exploiting our data.

### Protection Measures:
We have to protect our data by:
- Using strong passwords
- Investing in software solutions
- Fortifying your architecture so that unwanted persons wouldn't have access to your infrastructure
- Cutting against cybersecurity threats
- Investing in hardware and software solutions to fortify your architecture

## E-commerce and Online Shopping

The internet has enabled e-commerce and online shopping. You can log in, go to your favorite e-commerce application, and buy things - furniture, chairs, tables, whatever you want. Glasses, sunglasses. You go there, log in, go through the products, and begin to select products. Once you're satisfied and done, that automatically completes your shopping cart.

### E-commerce Process:
1. **Browse Products**: Look at your shopping cart and do some review
2. **Make Payment**: If you're happy, you could check out and make payment with your credit card or debit card
3. **Global Shopping**: The internet has changed the landscape, so you may now offer goods and services online
4. **Cross-border Commerce**: Customers may easily shop from any location - someone in Nigeria can buy things from the US or Europe
5. **Price Comparison**: You can compare prices across different e-commerce applications for the same product
6. **Reviews**: Read reviews for particular products to help you make purchasing decisions
7. **Secure Transactions**: Make complete secure transactions and payments online

## Social Media and Networking

Social media sites like Facebook have changed how we interact with one another, share information, and make connections. You can make connections on LinkedIn. If you have particular research you've worked on, you can publish that and share that on LinkedIn.

### Social Media Benefits:
- **Professional Networking**: You may have persons interested in your area who reach out to you, then you begin to collaborate and build your network
- **Content Sharing**: Share ideas on Facebook, and those interested can also reach you apart from likes and comments
- **Community Building**: You begin to collaborate, interact, and grow your community. Your network begins to grow and make connections
- **Global Connections**: People sharing their thoughts, experiences, and ideas on these platforms
- **Collaboration Opportunities**: Perhaps you might have those who would want to collaborate with you

You can log into other social network platforms, share videos, themes, and products. If you have software solutions, you can share that and begin to build connections.

## Entertainment and Streaming

Internet use has transformed how people consume entertainment. You can stream online using streaming platforms. You can stream and watch movies, watch TV series, and listen to music and podcasts in real time.

### Entertainment Options:
- **Streaming Services**: Companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Spotify allow you to go to these websites and begin to watch movies and TV series
- **Gaming Platforms**: You also have game platforms that support gaming. You log in, get to play games, and you're playing games with someone in the US while you're in Europe or Nigeria
- **Virtual Reality**: You can explore virtual reality space - the metaverse space. You have equipment that you can put before you, and then you have an experience of, for example, Dubai. You virtually have that equipment to experience California or other places
- **Music and Podcasts**: Listen to music and podcasts in real time
- **Global Gaming**: Play games with friends across the globe because of the internet

## Remote Work and Collaboration

It's possible to work remotely. You can sit and play games while having educational learning. It's possible now these days to log in and work remotely as a software developer. You sit at your machine, have the internet, and work with other software developers.

### Remote Work Features:
- **Collaborative Development**: You can access particular systems where whatever you develop flows into the system. Whatever other developers contribute also flows into the system, and you have a version control system that tries to merge the changes from multiple developers
- **Cloud-based Tools**: You can have cloud-based tools such as GIS, version control systems like Git, that help you manage changes
- **Global Teams**: Work with teams distributed across different countries and time zones
- **Productivity Tools**: Use various software solutions to support remote jobs, collaboration, and productivity
- **Cost Benefits**: The internet clearly supports remote jobs, improving productivity and collaboration

### Cloud Computing:
Once you're done, you can push whatever you have to the cloud using cloud-based tools. For example, Windows Azure is a cloud facility. People can log into their own machines to access whatever you've deployed to the cloud.

### Real-world Example:
I gave an example earlier - imagine you have a device attached to a person that monitors blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. If you have a pulse that goes high and that may be a red flag, the system can send that information to the internet. This is also connected to the internet. If there's a red flag, that information is sent to the internet and then maybe also sent to another IoT device enabled with an alarm and speaker. That would trigger an alarm, and then you have a doctor nearby who would respond to that alarm. Maybe this doctor will then telephone or call for an ambulance to be sent to this person for proper care. Because of that internet, you can see it's possible to save people's lives.
