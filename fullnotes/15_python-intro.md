# Python Programming Introduction

## What is an Interpreted Language?

An interpreted language is a language that gets converted from high level to low level at runtime. In this session, I will go over the fundamentals of Python programming language.

## Why Python?

Python is an excellent language for web development and data science. Python is an interpreted language, which means you can write and execute code directly without a need for a separate compilation step. This makes it a highly interactive language, allowing for quick iterations and experimentation.

Python is popular because it is high level and object oriented. Object oriented language means that one can develop programs using the idea of objects around us. Python was created in the 1980s. Python is also popular because it's simple and readable, making it one of the most preferred languages for beginners and experienced developers.

## Getting Started with Python

It's time to demonstrate the capacity of Python. Keep in mind that Python employs indentations to denote blocks. Let us start with the standard HelloWorld code. Visit the link to type the code: HelloWorld.

Once you're done typing, hit the run button to view your output. 

## Python Comments

Python also supports comments. Comments are usually added to code to describe what they do. For example, if you would like to print your first name, you would add comments as seen. Comments start with hash sign.

## Python Syntax

As you can observe, Python syntax is clean and readable. The function print is used to send information to the screen. The information inside the parenthesis is what will be sent to the screen. Python supports single and double quotes for strings.

## Built-in Functions

Python also supports a collection of built-in functions. These functions are available to make coding a wonderful experience. The function print is one of the built-in functions.

## Data Types

Python supports many data types. Some of these data types are integers, floats, strings, and boolean.

### Integer Data Type
The integer data type is used to store whole numbers. For example, you might want to store your age in a variable named age. You may also want to store the quantity of an item, for example, the number of pencils in a park.

### Float Data Type
Furthermore, a float data type is used to store decimal numbers. For example, you might want to store your exam score of 67.5 in a variable named score. Here the score is of type float.

### Boolean Data Type
Also, the boolean type is used to store true or false. Python also provides a variety of built-in operators on data.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
We can use arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For basic calculations, we might want to add two variables together.

### Variables and Assignment
Let's say A, B, and C are all variables of type integer. Python supports comparison operators like equals to, less than, and greater than for comparing values.

### Comparison Operators
This may be useful if you would like to compare two variables of the same type. From the image shown, answer is of the type boolean. This means answer could either be false or true. Can you guess the actual value stored in answer? The answer is false.

## String Manipulation

Python supports string manipulation using built-in functions. For example, a first name can be concatenated using the addition operator to generate a full name. Also, the addition operator could be used to add two numbers, for example, two and four. The first example is actually a concatenation operation while the second is an addition operation.

## Variables

Variable names in Python usually assign values. These values could be the name of a person, an integer, and many more values. Variable names are devoid of special characters. 

### Concatenation Rules
Concatenation can only work with variables of the same data type. For example, a string variable can be concatenated with another string variable. However, variables of different data types would give errors if you try to concatenate them.

## Conditional Statements

Python also supports conditional statements such as if and else statements. These conditional statements would also be combined with operators. The combination is used to branch into different code segments.

## Loop Constructs

Python provides powerful loop constructs such as for loops that allow you to repeat blocks of code. For example, the for loop can be used to go over a list of numbers and print each number one after the other.

## Data Structures

Python also has built-in data structures such as lists and dictionaries, which allow us to store and manipulate collections of data. This will be covered in the longer videos.
