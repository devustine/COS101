# Introduction to Computer Hardware Components

# Introduction to Computer Hardware - Lecture Transcript

Hi everyone, and welcome to our second session. In this session, we are going to be discussing introduction to computer hardware.

Before we begin, let me walk you through the learning objectives. The first is to discuss the basic components of the computer system, including input and output devices, central processing units (also known as processors), memory, and storage devices. We will also identify the different types of input and output devices, and explain the role of a processor in a computer system.

## What is Computer Hardware?

Computer hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that we can see. We can see the monitor, mouse, keyboard, and if you open up the computer, you can also see the CPU (processor), memory, and power supply. These are things we're going to be discussing.

Computer hardware consists of the physical parts of the computer that we can see. They include input devices, central processing units, memories, and storage devices.

## Components of Computer Hardware

Computer hardware includes input and output devices, the CPU, memories, and storage devices. These are things we naturally can see. For example, we can see the keyboard, and if you open up a computer, you can also see the CPU and hard disk. We can also see things connected to the computer system such as printers, which are output devices.

## The CPU (Central Processing Unit)

Let's start with the CPU, which is a processor. The first processor, the Intel 4004, was developed in 1971 with 2,300 transistors and operated at a speed of 106 kilohertz. The unit of processor speed is measured in hertz.

This means that it can process 106,000 instructions per second. So if you send a particular instruction to your processor, such as adding two plus two, it can process that 106,000 times per second, which was quite fast at that time.

These instructions are sent to the processor by the operating system. We will discuss operating systems in our next session. The processor decodes these instructions, which means understanding the task at hand. Once decoded, it begins to execute.

Just like you have an assignment before you, the first task will be to understand the assignment. Once you're able to understand the assignment, the next step will be to implement and solve that assignment.

That's what the processor does - it decodes instructions and tries to understand them. Once understood, it begins to execute. Modern processors can process more than a million instructions per second, which is really fast. The CPU is the central processing unit, and it sits on a motherboard.

## Motherboard

The motherboard is like a board that houses different components: the power supply, memory, hard disk, and similar components. You find those components sitting on the motherboard.

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

The next hardware device we're going to discuss is Random Access Memory (RAM). Let's call it RAM for short. The processor utilizes RAM by storing information temporarily to access it quickly. Sometimes the processor performs a particular operation, and the output will be stored temporarily in RAM so that it can fetch it quickly to perform other tasks as well.

The RAM allows the processor to run multiple programs at once. The more RAM you have, the better your computer's performance will be. For example, you might want to run editing software, a text editor, and photo editing applications. All those applications would naturally run in RAM.

From there, your processor can fetch those instructions to process. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can run. Whatever you have in RAM, once you shut down your computer, that information will be lost.

Information stored in RAM might include current documents you're working on, image files you just opened, or music files you're listening to. These files and applications currently run in RAM so that the processor can collect instructions from those applications to execute and send the output to the monitor for you to see.

RAM capacity is measured in bytes. A 16-megabyte RAM can hold about 16,000 bytes of information.

**Task for you:** How many bytes can 16 gigabytes of RAM hold?

## Storage Devices - Hard Disks

Now let's look at storage devices - hard disk drives. Hard disks store information permanently. Typically, if your hard disk is healthy, you'll store information there forever.

Hard disks store information permanently, such as video files, documents, photos, images, videos, music files, and series that you like to watch. Most of these are stored permanently on the hard disk. These files can last for a very long time as long as your hard disk is healthy and running. When you shut down your computer, the information stored on the hard disk will remain.

Compared to RAM, once you shut down your computer, the information you have in RAM will disappear. For example, editing software you're using to edit a particular photo, videos you're watching, or series you're watching - once you shut down the computer or turn off the power, these files would move from RAM. But for storage devices such as hard disks, that information will still persist.

When you shut down your computer, the information stored on a hard disk will remain. That's the beauty of your hard disk.

## Types of Hard Disks

There are two kinds of hard disks: Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD).

**HDDs (Hard Disk Drives):** These have movable parts, like a head that reads and writes information on the disc. Sometimes you hear your computer making a particular sound - that's the head trying to retrieve information from where a particular file is written so you can see and retrieve that file.

HDDs have a movable head that reads and writes to the disc. Because of these movable parts, HDDs are susceptible to damage since they move a lot during operation.

**SSDs (Solid State Drives):** These do not have any movable parts. They use integrated circuits and last longer because they don't have movable parts. However, they're really expensive - very expensive.

The capacity of storage devices is usually measured in bytes. A hard disk with a capacity of 50 megabytes can store information of size 50,000 bytes.

**Task for you:** If you have a hard disk of 50 gigabytes and another hard disk of one terabyte, how much information in bytes can each store?

## Input Devices

Input devices include keyboards, stylus pens, and sometimes devices for electronic signatures that can be input into the computer. For example, when applying for a passport, you would have to sign, and that signature will be stored in the computer and attached to your passport.

You also have the mouse, which can be wireless or connected with a cable to the computer. Input devices allow information to flow into the computer.

When you type on the keyboard - whether you're writing a letter, doing research, or typing in a Word document - that information naturally flows into the computer, and you see the output on the monitor.

Your mouse allows you to move cursors, and the outputs can be seen on the monitor. Stylus pens can be used for electronic signatures, which will be reflected on the monitor. When you type keys, that would also be reflected in documents or Word documents.

## Output Devices

Devices like printers, speakers, and monitors are called output devices because they allow information to flow out of a computer system. Just like when you connect audio to your computer, that sound is reflected through your speaker.

You would also send documents to your printer from your computer, which prints them out. Input from your keyboard is also reflected on your monitor.

## Read-Only Memory (ROM)

We're also looking at Read-Only Memory (ROM). ROM is a kind of memory that stores configuration data for a computer system.

This includes data such as how a computer will boot, where the computer will find the hard disk to load the operating system that will manage all the hardware devices attached to your computer.

You have that kind of configuration embedded in your ROM. Data such as how your computer will start up when you press the power button is usually available through software called BIOS (Basic Input and Output System).

The BIOS is software that resides in the ROM and ensures that computer hardware parts are working properly. When you turn on your computer, the first thing that happens is that the BIOS will inspect your hardware - the RAM, hard disk - to ensure they are working properly. Once that test is passed, it begins to load the operating system. We will discuss operating systems in our next session.

That's the function of the BIOS software that resides in the ROM.

## Power Unit

The power unit supplies power to all the components that require power. This includes the fan that cools the operating system and processor, as well as other key components such as the processor itself. These components require power, and the power unit naturally supplies power to those parts so they can carry out their functions.

If you're using a laptop, you would find batteries that provide power from the battery source. For desktop computers, the power unit is usually seen as an external component.

## Session Summary

That's it for this session. In this session, we've looked at computer parts including:

- The processor
- Input and output devices  
- Memory (RAM and ROM)
- Power units

These components work together to keep the computer operational and running, expanding the functions of the CPU or processor.

Thank you very much, and I'll see you in the next class.
