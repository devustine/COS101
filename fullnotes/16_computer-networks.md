# Computer Networks and Internet

## What are Computer Networks?

Computer networks are interconnected systems or devices that enable the exchange of information and resources. It could be your computer or your mobile device, and imagine your mobile device being able to connect to a particular computer. Now you have information being exchanged - that's what computer networks do.

They make it easier for computers, servers, routers, switches, and other network devices to communicate and exchange data. Switches connect two systems together, and routers help computers connect to the internet. You have your router and your computer, and then you can connect a computer to your router, which helps it connect to the internet.

Your routers and switches will help you connect two computers together. Computer networks make it easier for computers, servers, routers, switches, and other network devices to communicate and exchange data. In the connected world of today, computer networks are absolutely essential for facilitating collaboration, resource sharing, and effective communication.

You have your computer, you're able to connect to the internet, and now you're able to reach your friend on the other side. You can have two computers in a network and they're able to communicate. Imagine you install your Zoom software and now they're able to communicate because these two systems are connected and networked.

You can also have such networks locally within your space and environment. You can connect two systems with a switch, for example, and they're able to communicate - that's also a computer network.

## Key Components of Computer Networks

### Nodes

The things that are connected to a network are known as nodes. This could be your computer, your server, your printer, or any connected device. A laptop connected to a wireless device that can reach the internet can also be nodes. You have your mobile device, your printer, your desktop, and other devices - these are all nodes.

### Communication Channels

Data transmission between network devices is made possible by these channels. They can be wireless channels such as your WiFi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks (like your MTA or Globe networks). Once you connect your data from your mobile, you're able to reach the internet - that's a communication channel.

You also have wired channels where you have cables attached to your computer and data goes through them. That particular communication channel could be wired or wireless.

As an example of a wired communication network, imagine you have a cable that runs from your computer to a switch or router. From there, your computer can reach the internet through this wired approach. Or it could be wireless with your WiFi, where devices or nodes can communicate to other devices and access the internet.

### Protocols

We need to discuss how data is arranged and passed from one node to another. Data transmission and reception across the network are governed by sets of guidelines and standards known as protocols.

Just like you have channels where you have corridors where people can pass, you might also have some guidelines that tell individuals how they would pass through that particular corridor. You have some guidelines that assist people to go through that particular path. In the internet context, that is called protocol.

Examples include:
- **Ethernet** - for local networks. You might have your local network within your local space with two systems communicating using Ethernet protocols. System A and System B are connected by a switch, and Ethernet provides the standard or guideline for how data moves from computer A to computer B.
- **TCP/IP** - for transmission through the internet. When data passes through the internet, it is governed by TCP/IP protocols.

Within a local space, you have computers that can communicate through particular devices using switches that connect these two devices together. Ethernet can help guide or provide the platform where data is being passed from point A to point B.

### Topologies

The configuration or organization of interconnected devices in the network is defined as topologies. We have several types:
- Bus topology
- Star topology  
- Ring topology
- Mesh topology
- Stack topology
- Tree topology

## Network Architecture

Network architecture describes how hardware, software, protocols, and infrastructure are designed and arranged in relation to network work. It means how systems communicate in a network.

### Peer-to-Peer Architecture

Communication is peer-to-peer, where Computer A communicates directly with Computer B. Computer B can also communicate with Computer A.

### Client-Server Architecture

Different clients can reach out to a particular server. Each client can communicate to this server and request for particular materials or documents. You have printers that can also reach out - these are clients in a client-server approach.

### Cloud-Based Architecture

It could also be cloud-based networks. You have systems and computers, and each computer can reach a cloud facility through the internet to have infrastructure on the internet. Each client or computer can reach that particular infrastructure on the internet and request for information, files, documents, or videos.

## Network Types

### Local Area Network (LAN)

This is the kind of network you typically have in your home. Imagine you have a wireless device and within that space you have your computer, another computer, and a printer. You also have a mobile device - this forms a local area network.

Within that space, you're able to reach the internet and communicate. Computers can also communicate and share files. You typically use LAN for the whole setting.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

You will use this in office systems. Imagine you have your office in a particular state and also have branches in other locations (say Abuja). These offices can connect and reach each other. Office A in Abuja can reach the internet and also reach the main branch in Lagos. That's like a wide area network used to connect office systems.

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

This spans across countries, connecting networks like Qatar to other countries.

You have your computers connected, and you can reach the internet. Computers can also communicate among themselves. Within that local network, you also have your smartphone connected. You can reach other devices within that local network, and you have offices scattered across different locations.

Maybe you have branches A, B, C, and D. Each branch can reach the internet and connect to other branches to request files and resources. Branch D can go through the network and reach a particular file or system and request a file from branch B. That is the wide area network, and for metropolitan networks, it cuts across countries.

## The Internet

The internet is a global network of linked computer networks that enables communication and information sharing among users all over the world. Different networks can connect to the internet and reach other networks for resources.

The internet is a massive network of computers, servers, and other devices connected by various wired and wireless links. It's a massive connection of networks and other devices connected by wired and wireless links.

These links connect different networks together so that you are able to reach a particular computer. Imagine you have Google tools - Google resides in a particular server. If you're connected to internet from your locality, you can reach out to Google's servers and request information.

The internet can help you reach and access information online. Using it means you're able to retrieve and get information from another server computer on the internet. You can use your laptop, smartphones, or tablets to connect to the internet.

## Benefits of the Internet

There are lots of benefits:

1. **Social Networking** - You're able to do social networking online
2. **Access to Libraries** - You can access libraries online
3. **Email Services** - The internet can handle emails and file collection
4. **Information Access** - You can find information online
5. **Online Payments** - You can make payments online because these systems are connected
6. **Communication** - You can communicate through Zoom and other online platforms
