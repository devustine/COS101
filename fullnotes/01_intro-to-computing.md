# History of Computing

## Origins of Computing

### The Abacus
The history of computing started thousands of years back with the creation of the Abacus. Abacus is a simple counting device used by the ancient Egyptians and Chinese.

### Mechanical Calculators (17th Century)
The emergence of mechanical calculators came to limelight in the 17th century. An example of a mechanical calculator is the **Pascaline**. This device paved the way for modern computing.

## Electronic Computers Era

### First Electronic Computer (1946)
Electronic computers came into limelight in the 20th century. In 1946, the electronic numerical integrator and computer was introduced, heralding a new era of computing. This computer was the world's first general proposed electronic digital computer. It was built during World War II by the United States Army during the years 1943 to 1945 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.

This computer focused on mathematical calculations for scientific and military purposes.

### Mainframe Computers (1960s-1970s)
In the 1960s and 1970s, mainframe computers which were large and expensive were the norm. These large computers were used by government agencies and other large organizations to process inventory, payroll, and full research.

### Personal Computers (1980s)
In the 1980s, we saw the emergence of a new brand of computers called personal computers. Examples include:
- Apple II
- IBM PC

These computers had relatively high computing power compared to mainframe systems. This led to the creation of new industries and the transformation of existing ones.

## Modern Computing Era

### Mobile Computing (21st Century)
We have seen the emergence of mobile computing in the 21st century with smartphones and tablets becoming very common. This has resulted in a world where people are always connected and have access to vast amounts of information at their fingertips.

### The Internet Revolution
The internet is arguably one of the most significant developments in computing. It has transformed the way we communicate, work, and learn. The internet has also brought people closer like never before. Social media platforms have also latched onto the internet. They have also affected the way we communicate and the way we express our opinions and views.

### Artificial Intelligence (Present Day)
Finally, we come to the present day way. Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we live and work. AI stands for artificial intelligence. It refers to replicating human thought in machines and computers. AI has been leveraged in:
- Healthcare
- Finance
- Oil and gas
- Transportation

AI has the potential to change the landscape of other industries.
