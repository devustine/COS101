# Computer Specifications and Choosing the Right Computer

There are several factors to be considered when buying a computer. One of the most important of them is the type of computer.

### 1. Type of Computer

As mentioned in our previous lecture, we have different types of computers:
- Desktops
- Laptops
- Servers
- Mobile devices

So clearly your choice will be influenced by your lifestyle and reason for purchase.

#### Usage Examples
- **For mobile software development**: If you would be developing mid-level software applications on the move, then a laptop would be a great choice for office work
- **For high-level tasks**: However, if you need to perform high-level tasks such as machine learning development, then a desktop will serve you better

### 2. CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The next and equally important factor to consider is the CPU.

#### CPU Speed Measurement
- **How it's measured**: The CPU speed is measured by how many instructions it can process per second
- **Unit of measurement**: This is measured in hertz
- **Definition of hertz**: Hertz is a unit of frequency that measures the number of cycles per second

#### CPU Performance
- **Usage**: It is typically used to describe the clock speed of the CPU, which is determined by the rate at which instructions are executed
- **Modern CPUs**: Modern CPUs typically have clock speeds in the range of gigahertz, which means they can execute billions of cycles per second
- **Example**: For example, a six-megahertz CPU specification means it can process 6 million instructions per second

#### Popular CPU Brands
- Intel
- AMD
- However, other processor vendors exist

### 3. RAM (Random Access Memory)

A computer's RAM is also another specification to look into. As previously mentioned, the RAM stores information temporarily.

#### RAM Capacity
- **Importance**: It is therefore important to consider how much information it can hold
- **Measurement**: RAM size is measured in bytes, so six megabytes means the RAM can store information of 6 million bytes
- **Performance**: The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can store

### 4. Storage Devices

Two kinds of storage exist:

#### Hard Drives (HDD)
- **History**: Hard drives have existed for more than 30 years
- **How they work**: It has a movable head that tries to retrieve or write information into the disc. In other words, the information resides on a disc
- **Cost**: Hard drives are typically cheaper

#### Solid State Drives (SSD)
- **How they work**: On the other hand, solid state drives do not have movable parts. They store the information on integrated circuits
- **Cost**: Solid state drives are more expensive options because integrated circuits are expensive
- **Durability**: Aside from the pricing nature, SSDs do not wear and tear because they do not have mobile parts. Unlike the hard disk

### 5. Graphics Card

If you plan on using your computer for graphics-intensive applications, a dedicated graphics card is important.

#### Functions of Graphics Cards
- **Processing power**: This dedicated device speeds up calculations for complex operations like matrix multiplication and other computational power in games
- **Performance enhancement**: A graphics card enhances the performance of the computer by handling graphics processing

### 6. Screen Resolution

Furthermore, the screen resolution is another specification to consider.

#### Benefits and Requirements
- **Image quality**: While higher screen resolution provides sharper and more detailed images, they require more processing power
- **Pixel density**: The more pixels on the monitor, the sharper the images would appear for those in graphics and animation
- **Quality indicator**: Having more pixels on the monitor would also suggest better quality

#### Resolution Format
- **Example**: As an example, monitor resolutions are usually in the format 1920 by 1080 pixels
- **How to read**: Monitor resolutions are typically written as a pair of numbers representing the number of horizontal and vertical pixel cells that the monitor can display
- **Detailed example**: For example, a monitor with the resolution 1920 by 1080 pixel cells can display 1920 pixel cells horizontally and 1080 pixel cells vertically

### 7. Battery Life

Next is battery life.

#### Importance for Laptops
- **Mobility**: For laptops, battery life is worth considering. If you plan to use your laptop while on the go, you would want to choose a computer with a longer battery life
- **Remote work**: For laptops, battery life is essential. The ability to work comfortably remotely and without being plugged in is an important factor

#### Factors Affecting Battery Life
Battery life can vary widely depending on factors like:
- The size of the battery
- Power consumption
- Usage

### 8. Computer Brand

Finally, the computer brand is also an important consideration.

#### Popular Computer Brands
- Dell
- HP
- Lenovo
- Apple

#### Brand Considerations
Each brand has strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to research and read reviews before making a purchase.

## Matching Computer to Your Needs

When choosing a computer, it is important to consider your needs and budget.

### Basic Usage
If you plan to use a computer for basic tasks such as:
- Web browsing
- Email

A low-end computer may suffice.

### Demanding Tasks
However, if you plan to use a computer for more demanding tasks such as:
- Game development
- Animation
- Graphic design

You would want to choose a computer with higher specifications.
