# Computer Specifications and Choosing the Right Computer

Have you ever purchased a laptop based on how trendy and cool it is? If your answer is yes, how did it go?

Welcome to this session on computer specifications. Having previously explored computer parts, I will shed light on choosing the right computer based on its major components. There are several factors to be considered when buying a computer. One of the most important of them is the type of computer.

As mentioned in our previous lecture, we have different types of computers. We have desktops, laptops, servers, and mobile devices.

So clearly your choice will be influenced by your lifestyle and reason for purchase. Would you be developing mid-level software applications on the move? If your answer is yes, then a laptop would be a great choice for office work.

However, if you need to perform high-level tasks such as machine learning development, then a desktop will serve you better. The next and equally important factor to consider is the CPU. The CPU speed is measured by how many instructions it can process per second. This is measured in hertz.

Hertz is a unit of frequency that measures the number of cycles per second. It is typically used to describe the clock speed of the CPU, which is determined by the rate at which instructions are executed. Modern CPUs typically have clock speeds in the range of gigahertz, which means they can execute billions of cycles per second. For example, a six-megahertz CPU specification means it can process 6 million instructions per second. Intel and AMD are popular processors in the market. However, other processor vendors exist.

A computer's RAM is also another specification to look into. As previously mentioned, the RAM stores information temporarily. It is therefore important to consider how much information it can hold. RAM size is measured in bytes, so six megabytes means the RAM can store information of 6 million bytes. The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can store. Two kinds of storage exist.

The first is hard drive and the second is solid state drives. Hard drives have existed for more than 30 years. It has a movable head that tries to retrieve or write information into the disc. In other words, the information resides on a disc.

Hard drives are typically cheaper. On the other hand, solid state drives do not have movable parts. They store the information on integrated circuits.

Solid state drives are more expensive options because integrated circuits are expensive. Aside from the pricing nature, SSDs do not wear and tear because they do not have mobile parts. Unlike the hard disk, if you plan on using your computer for graphics-intensive applications, a dedicated graphics card is important. This dedicated device speeds up calculations for complex operations like matrix multiplication and other computational power in games.

A graphics card enhances the performance of the computer by handling graphics processing. Furthermore, the screen resolution is another specification to consider.

While higher screen resolution provides sharper and more detailed images, they require more processing power. The more pixels on the monitor, the sharper the images would appear for those in graphics and animation. Having more pixels on the monitor would also suggest better quality. As an example, monitor resolutions are usually in the format 1920 by 1080 pixels. Monitor resolutions are typically written as a pair of numbers representing the number of horizontal and vertical pixel cells that the monitor can display, for example, a monitor with the resolution 1920 by 1080 pixel cells can display 1920 pixel cells horizontally and 1080 pixel cells vertically. Next is battery life.

For laptops, battery life is worth considering. If you plan to use your laptop while on the go, you would want to choose a computer with a longer battery life. For laptops, battery life is essential. The ability to work comfortably remotely and without being plugged in is an important factor.

Battery life can vary widely depending on factors like the size of the battery, power consumption, and usage. Finally, the computer brand is also an important consideration. Popular computer brands include Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Apple. Each brand has strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to research and read reviews before making a purchase. When choosing a computer, it is important to consider your needs and budget.

If you plan to use a computer for basic tasks such as web browsing and email, a low-end computer may suffice. However, if you plan to use a computer for more demanding tasks such as game development, animation and graphic design, you would want to choose a computer with higher specifications. In conclusion, understanding computer specifications and choosing the right computer can be overwhelming, but with ample research and consideration, you can find a computer that is right for you. 

Since we have explored the factors to consider when purchasing a computer, it is important to recall that the brand might not necessarily be the deciding factor. For some people, discussions in forums help them create a priority list and regard these factors according to what they consider most important and least important. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next class.
