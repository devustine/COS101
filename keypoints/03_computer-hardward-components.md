# Introduction to Computer Hardware - Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Computer hardware consists of the physical components of a computer system, including input devices, output devices, the CPU, memory, storage devices, and power units.
- The CPU (Central Processing Unit) decodes and executes instructions; it was first introduced with the Intel 4004 processor in 1971, operating at 106 kHz.
- RAM (Random Access Memory) temporarily stores data for quick access by the processor, while storage devices like hard disks permanently store information.
- Storage devices come in two main types: Hard Disk Drives (HDD) with moving parts and Solid State Drives (SSD) without moving parts.
- Input devices include keyboards, mice, and stylus pens, while output devices include monitors, printers, and speakers.
- ROM (Read-Only Memory) stores essential configuration data such as BIOS, which controls hardware checks and the computerâ€™s boot process.

## Key Points and Definitions

- **Computer Hardware:** Physical parts of a computer system.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The main processor that decodes and executes instructions.
- **Intel 4004 (1971):** First commercial processor with 2,300 transistors, 106 kHz speed.
- **Hertz (Hz):** Unit for measuring processor speed (instructions per second).
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary, volatile memory for active data.
- **Hard Disk Drive (HDD):** Storage device with moving parts for permanent data storage.
- **Solid State Drive (SSD):** Storage device using integrated circuits, faster and more durable than HDDs.
- **Input Devices:** Devices that allow data to be entered into a computer (keyboard, mouse, stylus).
- **Output Devices:** Devices that present data from a computer (monitor, printer, speaker).
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Non-volatile memory storing system configuration and BIOS.
- **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System):** Firmware in ROM that initiates hardware checks and loads the operating system.
- **Power Unit:** Supplies electrical power to computer components.
