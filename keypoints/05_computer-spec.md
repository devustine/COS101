# Computer Specifications and Choosing the Right Computer

## Summary

- The type of computer you choose should align with your lifestyle and intended use (e.g., desktops for high-level tasks like machine learning, laptops for office work on the move).
- Important specifications to consider include CPU speed, RAM capacity, storage type, graphics card, screen resolution, battery life, and brand.
- CPU speed, measured in hertz (Hz), determines how many instructions a processor can handle per second.
- RAM, measured in bytes, temporarily holds data for quick access by the CPU — more RAM allows handling more simultaneous data.
- Storage options include traditional Hard Drives (HDD) with moving parts and Solid State Drives (SSD) which are faster, more durable, but pricier.
- Dedicated graphics cards are essential for graphics-intensive tasks like gaming, animation, and complex computations.

## Key Points and Definitions

- **Computer Types**: Desktop, Laptop, Server, Mobile Device.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Processes instructions per second, measured in hertz (Hz). 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles/second.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporarily stores data for quick processing. Measured in bytes.
- **Storage Types**:
  - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Uses movable heads and spinning disks. More affordable.
  - **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Uses integrated circuits. Faster, no moving parts, more expensive.
- **Graphics Card**: Dedicated hardware for handling complex graphics processing tasks.
- **Screen Resolution**: Number of horizontal and vertical pixels on a monitor. Example: 1920×1080 pixels.
- **Battery Life**: Important for laptop portability, varies by battery size, power consumption, and usage.
- **Popular Brands**: Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple.
