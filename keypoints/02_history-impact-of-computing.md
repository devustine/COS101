## Key Points & Facts

### Early Computing History
- **Abacus**: An ancient mechanical device used for counting and basic calculations.
- Beads arranged to count in units (1-5) and groups of fives, tens, and fifties.

### Vacuum Tube Computers
- **ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator)**: First general-purpose electronic computer.
- Developed by **Prosper Eckert** and colleagues, **1943-1945**.
- Contained approximately **50,000 vacuum tubes** and required significant physical space.

### Transistors and Integrated Circuits
- **Transistor**: Developed in **1947**, replaced vacuum tubes making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable.
- **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**: Emerged in the **late 1950sâ€“1960s**, allowing multiple transistors on a single silicon chip.

### Personal Computers
- Driven by the **1970s microprocessor revolution**.
- Modern microprocessors integrate hundreds of thousands of ICs, found in desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

## Impact on Various Sectors

### Education
- Computers and the internet enable online learning, virtual experiments, remote access to educational materials, and global collaboration.

### Communication
- Tools like **WhatsApp**, **Zoom**, **Facebook Messenger**, and **Twitter** enable instant global communication and collaboration.

### Healthcare
- Digital imaging, remote diagnoses, and even remote surgeries are facilitated through computers and internet connectivity.

### Entertainment
- Computers enable global online gaming, video streaming, and multimedia experiences via fast processors and internet access.

## Ethical Implications and Challenges

### Cybersecurity Threats
- Risks include system shutdowns and data breaches caused by malicious software and hackers.

### Cyberbullying
